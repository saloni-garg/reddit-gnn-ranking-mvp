1l5lw1l,[Help] Problem with our gas stove,CanaryPhysical5657,Home,5,2,1749305892.0,"Last year around april we had a different gas stove and had a similar problem. There was gas leaking out the burners, so we called the specialist that installed it (it's a recent construction) and he checked the installation and said there was no problem other than the pressure was very high but he had no real explanation for it. We then changed the gas bottle, thinking it would fix the problem but it did not.

We were anxious so we called a different specialist, he checked the installation and said there was no problem, again, he said the same thing, very high pressure but unable to explain why. Then we called the maintenance service of the gas stove, thinking the problem might have come from the stove itself. A maintenance person was planned to come check it, but the day right before his intervention, when I was cooking, the fire would not stop even though I turned it off. We then proceeded to turn off the gas bottle and called the Fire Department, afraid of a domestic fire. (Luckily we had no problem)

Then the next day, the maintenance person inspected the gas stove and noticed no problems from it, he simply said that the installation was dangerous, but did not explained why.
They simply replaced the stove with another just to make us feel less anxious about it and told us to fix the gas installation. We then called another specialist and he replaced the gas regulator with ""a better one"". 

During all winter we had no problems, but now it starts reacting the same way as it did back then. Afraid of another fire, we purged the gas from the whole installation and turned it off. Does anyone have an explanation for it or do I have to pay another specialist to hear the same thing over and over ? üòì
Thank you for your replies."

It pretty much matches the same temperature of the outside and I can handle it in the winter, but in the summer it gets hotter than a torture chamber and I actually want to die trying to do literally anything in here. The room is over the garage and facing the sun in the afternoon. We‚Äôve had the windows replaced and temperature control curtains put in to try and regulate the heat but I haven‚Äôt noticed it being any more pleasant. It‚Äôs always so stuffy and humid in here even with the fan on, windows open/ closed, door open. It‚Äôs awful. Even right outside the room there‚Äôs a noticeable temperature drop.

How do I fix this?"

1l5v64v,Cooling: fancoil or A/C?,Magnetinis,Home,1,0,1749330255.0,"Hello, I‚Äôm considering a cooling solution for a 100 m¬≤ A++ energy class house (2 floors). So far, I‚Äôve narrowed it down to two options ‚Äì an air conditioner or a fan coil unit (an air-water heat pump will be installed). From what I‚Äôve gathered, air conditioners cool more efficiently than fan coils, but the latter is cheaper to install.

So my question is: is the higher efficiency of an air conditioner really that big of an advantage, or can a fan coil unit also do the job well and cool the rooms sufficiently?

Additionally, fresh air will be supplied through a recuperation system, and underfloor heating is planned for heating."
1l5v2qv,Do I need to do anything about this ‚Äúexposed‚Äù rim joist?,pnl560,Home,1,0,1749330012.0,"There‚Äôs about 5 feet of exposed/uncovered rim joist between the house and free standing deck.

I know the previous homeowners had aluminum siding replaced with vinyl siding before I moved in.

I suspect during siding replacement project, the existing deck (along with two vents) was in the way - so the siding company decided to be ‚Äúcreative.‚Äù

Below the deck is still the original aluminum siding but unsure why the same aluminum siding is missing from this 5 ft section.

No house wrap or sheathing in front of this area either. 

Should I do something about this?

If so, what is a good solution?

From what I can tell, the rim joist is still in good condition.

The Emperor, to clarify, is not a good person, he doesn't love you, he doesn't care about you, and 95% of what he says are lies. A very bold move on Larian's part to lock in that hard but I love it.

According to the lore, Mindflayers will do ***whatever it takes*** to get what they want, which is to rule, dominate, control and reshape things according to their designs. Evidence of the Emperor being no different is his controlling of Stelmane to reshape Baldur's Gate according to his will. For the city's benefit in some ways, but there are lists of people he had 'silenced' in the Knights of the Shields' HQ and evidence that he kept people in cages and chains to feed on when hungry. I've read some people say he's true neutral, I doubt it.

When he meets the player character, his first move is to do whatever it takes to make you his next thrall to help him wrest free from the Elder Brain and continue his own agenda. Thralls are important to mindflayers since they have a need to dominate and control another mind, without one, they become apathetic and sluggish. It's very much a physical need. So he takes on a pleasing form and lies to you, obfuscates the truth and poses as a fellow adventurer in a bind to get you to trust him and do what he wants.

Everything he does from there is entirely to control you, right till the very end. Even his romance, is just him enjoying how utterly enthralled you have become by him. He lies to you, even then, because he doesn't spend the night with you because he cares about you, he does it because it solidifies your loyalty to him and shows how completely oblivious you are to his real thoughts. He has no need for romance or physical lovemaking, your brainless adulation is enough to make him happy.

Mindflayers are also said to have favourite thralls they won't feed on, will keep happy and healthy and give toys and perks. This is you if you never challenge his actions. 

Throughout the game, there are subtle hints about him. A book that details how mindlfayers manipulate, the constant option to call him out on pretending and lying, the companions' doubts, Wyll's dialogue about Stelmane having a stroke and never being the same after. His admiration of how 'beautiful is it to watch Orpheus in his mind-prison'. And even his own reactions to you making decisions he doesn't want you to make.

If you push back, you get the real face of the Emperor. He isn't Balduran anymore, not really. He's using you, and rather than reduce you to a dullard fleshbag for him to puppet - party because he needs you sharp - he simply decided a different approach to enthrallment this time. If called out, he'll come clean. You're a tool that will do what he tells you to, when he tells you to. If you won't fall for his charms, you'll simply be brute-forced instead. 

Further evidence I'd say is that he won't even consider doing what you suggest if you try to free Orpheus. If he truly valued you, or cared or trusted you, it would be different but it's not. Hard no. Do as I say. No compromise.

That is the genius of this character. Just like a mindflayer in the lorebooks, it takes constant vigilance and pushing back to avoid falling for his manipulations. Half truths, lies, deceptions, a soothing voice, compliments, pretending to treat you like a valued equal, even approving of your pushback against him. In real life, this is how truly manipulative people operate, never back down, never drop the mask, even when called out.

I love it. I love how they looked at what a mindflayer is and decided. ""Let's see how well we can obfuscate the true nature of this character."" "
1l5rv56,The false urgency bit in Act 1 tricks so many newbies,excursionista,BaldursGate3,567,88,1749321385.0,"I saw a few TikToks about the game and thought it looked right up my alley so I downloaded and got to work. I fell for the false urgency of the tadpole bit and blasted my way through Act 1. 


After I made it to the underdark I realized that I wasn‚Äôt going to actually transform into a mind flayer and slowed down and started exploring more thoroughly. I made it to the Gauntlet of Shar in Act 2, and when I dove a bit deeper into bg3 TikTok I realized I completely missed Karlach AND SCRATCH in Act 1. I had no idea why Mizora randomly showed up and gave Wyll horns, must have ignored that bit?? Also I killed Minthara and didn‚Äôt realize you could have her as a companion without raiding the grove. Also completely skipped the cr√®che. I‚Äôve now seen several TikTok‚Äôs and some posts on this Reddit about people doing the same thing üòÇ Glad to know I‚Äôm not alone on this. 

I decided to start a new save and actually thoroughly explore the Act 1 area. Scratch is now happily chilling at my camp. It‚Äôs crazy how much easier the first bit of this game is now that I know what I‚Äôm doing, so I‚Äôm excited to do a better job of playing the game fully and finding all of the side quests without the false urgency of thinking I‚Äôm about to turn into a mind flayer and being afraid to take long rests.

After starting almost 2 years ago with nearly 700 hours across 4 campaigns in the first year then taking a year off I FINALLY finished my first campaign and I'm so freaking satisfied. Obviously in that time I ran across a lot of spoilers and I didn't think there would be anything to surprise me but...

Even though I knew my Tiefling druid would go to Avernus with her husband Wyll (who I was NOT expecting to be my first romance until I saw the little horned cuties dancing üò≠) and their bestie/wife Karlach... the actual scene had me SCREECHING.

Karlach just lighting up a few stoagies with her thumb before sassing me and running into the hells... the ultimate chef's kiss. I thought seeing the end might discourage me from finishing my other files but now I just HAVE to see how my other kids fare in their various stories.

I started a battle with a successful arcane interference arrow to disrupt Lorroakan's magic. In response he used the exact same magic I disrupted and sent a magical attack in reaction... magic reaction after I broke his concentration and prevented for at least a turn. Game said I hit him and disrupted his magic, then he retaliated with magic!

Frustrated I decided to brute force him with my party's tank, given that he couldn't possibly have many 12-96 hit reactions... he did it again, and again, and again, and again.... I brutally hit five times in a single turn and he kept shooting magical attacks he didn't have! He effectively took out my 'tank' character's entire health with him being brought to \~25% amongst attacks from two of my characters. My rogue was also brought to less than 50%. I'm doing this on 'Balanced' and there HAS to be a better solution than sacrificing characters to breach his defenses. Also the elementals he summoned didn't despawn when he was killed, only raising more questions as to how magic works in this game. What am I missing here?

This wasn't a particularly hard battle, but I only did it through brute force and sacrificing my party members. Where's the strategy here?"

Assumed it was just for grabbing stuff for all chests, and as I tend to set each chest up so each only accepts certain items, I never built it as I know exactly which chest has what I'm looking for to access ammo / weapons / blueprints, or to drop off ore/ pal parts / food items.

Imagine my surprise when I found out it acts as a 'Smart' deposit box. Just a one stop drop Post pal expedition / oil rig trip/ dungeon run and everything gets plonked into its allocated chest (provided there is at least one of it in a chest).   
  
Only exception being the guild box, but as I only have one Main base that has everything, that's only used for raid / rig weapons so I can access em at my raid base.

1l5i55g,Having trouble around mid-endgame,Ferrinova,Palworld,13,18,1749293890.0,"I'm starting to feel like everything requires a superbase dedicated to certain farming. I love making a small compact base but i'm no longer able to actually produce enough stone, wood, cement supplies for spheres or cake supplies.

Breeding in palworld has been very tough, i am still stuck trying to get eternal engine, swift and runner onto my nitewing with over 50 cakes used now. From the looks of it i need to have an insane amount of cakes just to make this process work smoothly and that means a huge base because i used up my small ones resources i gathered overtime just making 50 cakes.

Pals past lvl 30 need red spheres to catch without a huge RNG hassle, but the cement per sphere is insanely high. I can't mine enough rock even with x3 resources and resource health, while my rock mine can't keep up even with 3 digitose, one having artisan.

I have a hard time using more than one base because food demand is high even on low workspeed, so i need to make a huge farm which requires another base. I can barely fit things in any of my bases and having multiple base layers doesn't work because the pals have a ton of issues with pathing. My game lags hard with these farms because the pals can't always pick up items so a lot of it is left sitting even with 3 mimogs, anubis or wumpos on transport duty.

I feel spread thin and its becoming very stressful to not only manage 3+ bases but also deal with all the bugs from pathing or not picking up items. There is so much to manage and a large part of advancement is condensing pals and breeding those work passives for base and this has been the biggest roadblock right now.

I've been taking breaks almost every day getting burnt out trying to make this all work. I don't know what to do anymore i feel like i'm going to have to grind hard for months just to get things running smoothly."

Instead of building up like most people do, we set ourselves a different challenge - to build *downward*, transforming the entire underground space into a fully functioning base. From the surface, all you‚Äôll see is a quiet lake resort‚Ä¶ but beneath it lies something entirely different.

The base runs deep, completely concealed, and is designed with care to feel calm and natural ‚Äî both for us, and for the Pals who call it home.

I‚Äôve shared a few screenshots here, but if you're curious to see how everything fits together, there's more info in my comment below.

1l5lmnc,"AITA for not cooking ""fancier"" meals?",Local_Moment_4782,AmItheAsshole,3935,915,1749305156.0,"I'm the only one who cooks in our house. It's just 4 of us, my husband, me and my daughter and little brother. My husband is 27 and I'm 25.

My husband barely knows how to make eggs, even though I've tried to talk to him constantly about learning how to cook. My daughter and brother are still in elementary school so they only help me cook.

The responsibility falls on me and it's honestly exhausting.. so, I just set up a system in my head. It's easy, for breakfast It's just something with eggs or cereal. Lunch is some sort of sandwich, burger, or leftovers. Dinner is the meal I usually plan but I have like 10 dishes I repeat. Sometimes I'll go off, especially Sunday, but generally I stay because it's easier for me mentally.

Well, one day I made just pasta alfredo with chicken and as we were eating, my husband mentions that it would be nice if I made ""fancier"" dishes. I asked him what he meant and he explained he wants me to change things up, add some more meat dishes and variety.

Next time, we went out shopping and i was putting ingredients I don't usually buy into the cart. As the ingredients started piling up, my husband was getting all puffy and upset. We got to the meat aisle and I started picking out beef and that's when my husband lost it and started taking things out of the cart. Saying that we can't afford my ""fancy living"". I blinked at him and tried to explain that he was the one who asked for variety and different dishes, so I'm buying different ingredients. 

He rolled his eyes and told me that I'm being dramatic. I just let him do his thing, taking out most of the ingredients out. 

The next week, I made the same dishes because that's all I had ingredients for. A week passed and my husband was all pouting that I made fried rice again and that he's sick of chicken. When I pointed out that he took out all the beef out of our cart, he blew up on me again and said I'm being an asshole because he doesn't know how to cook? 

AITA?"
1l5k9wy,AITA for sitting braless in my garden?,Lameastronaute,AmItheAsshole,2541,1074,1749301221.0,"We are living in a complex, and have a small garden within for ourselves. There are bushes planted by the complex, but they are not super high, so you can see the neighbours in their own garden, and from the shared inner garden-space. 
A neighbour complained to me, for sitting in only a shirt, no bra in our ""patio""/own garden. I am a bit scared they will complain on the shared Facebook group of the complex, as that would be humiliating so I apologized out of shock and went with it.

Now I am thinking I shouldn't have - like come on I could be braless in public, but especially within our own garden... I am planning to keep sitting braless, but would I be the asshole if next time I see him I would say something?
I feel silly getting upset this, i think what I did is normal, but maybe I shouldn't openly make a debate out of it in the complex...?"

She asked me to help out here and there with packaging and social media stuff, saying it‚Äôd be chill and fun. I agreed 'cause I wanted to support her. At first, it was super low-key, like an hour or two a week. But over the last couple of months, it‚Äôs gotten way out of hand. She sends me daily to-do lists, expects me to drop everything for her biz, and gets mad if I don‚Äôt put her stuff before my actual job.

She‚Äôs even started calling me her ""social media assistant"" to our friends, even though I‚Äôm not paid at all. Last week, she told me I had to spend my entire Saturday helping her prep for a craft fair, saying, ""You owe me this, you‚Äôre part of the team!""

I told her nicely that I love supporting her, but I‚Äôm not her employee and my time is valuable. I said I couldn‚Äôt keep helping if it‚Äôs not casual and if there‚Äôs no pay for all the extra work. Chloe flipped out and called me selfish, saying I was ""abandoning"" her and not a real friend. Now she‚Äôs telling our friends I‚Äôm the bad guy for not helping her ""dream"" come true.

Their wedding is next month, and honestly, this whole thing has been rough on me.

Recently, I bought a stunning, expensive designer dress for a fancy charity event I‚Äôm going to next month. It‚Äôs a special dress, and I felt like I deserved to treat myself after everything.

Yesterday, Mia saw the dress and immediately asked to borrow it to wear to Ben and Zoe‚Äôs wedding. She said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfect! I need to look amazing, and you‚Äôre not even using it right now.‚Äù I was floored. I told her no, that it‚Äôs for my event, and it would feel so wrong for her to wear it to that wedding. She got super mad and called me ridiculous and selfish, telling our parents I‚Äôm a terrible sister for saying no.

1l5rtx3,WIBTA for yelling at my mom for humiliating me over brain surgery,poisonousrat312,AmItheAsshole,360,45,1749321300.0,"I [18] f snapped at my mother today after she made a comment about what happened when my brain was swollen
for context around 2020 ish when I was fourteen I had a sinus infection go to my brain  after my sinuses filled up. I was sick for around two weeks and begged my mom to take me to the er. she would tell me that if I went I would need to get shots in my butt- I wasn't scared of needles however I was majorly self conscious as every teen is- so I would go home and used remedies like the neddipot and vapor spray. it got to the point where I couldnt hold anything in. eventually she took me to the hospital while I was out of it- like blank stares and not responding- and they told mely mom I was dehydrated and wasn't taking my meds properly and sent me out. I peed my pants on the way out and after cleaning me up I had ""seizure like activity"" as the doctors call it and mom took me to a different er which sent me to a bigger hospital. after a couple months I got out of the hospital and am now doing fine besides mild migraines but the doctors said that if I waited for another day I would be dead or brain dead and my life would be over.

now my mom talks about this but bends the truth-
she says I was just acting depressed
that I never asked to go to the hospital 
and makes sure to tell them that I wet myself in public

this would happen MANY MANY times and this recent time she mentions it i finally said something about her refusing to take me to the doctor in the first place despite me being clearly physically unwell. I would also mention the fact that she admitted she knew I had a sinus infection to the doctors. 

after the people she was talking to left she snapped at me saying that I don't understand how hard the ordeal was for her and that I make her sound like a horrible parent.

I leave it too you reddit, was I a ignorant brat when I brought up what I did or was my anger justified as it made me feel embarrassed every time she'd talk about it?"
1l5dkr6,AITA for moving away and making my friend homeless and then ignoring her calls for help?,Technical_Dentist885,AmItheAsshole,3853,146,1749275191.0,"I (31F) have this friend (33F) who has been living with me these past 3 years. She wasn't on the lease. Nor did she pay rent but she did give me money occasionally and would buy stuff for the apartment. In the beginning she would help with cleaning like doing dishes sometimes. She did have a habit of collecting useless junk (used bike tires for example) that would start piling up in my dining room and she would get upset if I threw something away or moved it. We got in a few arguements over it. Her reasons being that these items was all she had and that I wouldn't understand because I grew up ""privileged"" so of course I didn't see what the big deal was throwing away these items. I still don't to be honest.

Anyways after a while I began to feel alot of resentment towards her and I felt she had started taking me for granted. I ended up moving. I told her I planned on moving 2 months prior but she didn't seem to take me seriously. Or maybe she assumed I was taking her with me? Idk. But I moved. And because of that she is now homeless.

She's been calling me daily saying she doesn't feel good and that she doesn't know what to do and now she just sits in front of 711 doing nothing. I stopped answering her calls. And I feel bad but I just don't want her living with me anymore. It's like she's completely dependent on others to come rescue her and it's exhausting. Why do I feel like such a bad person? Should I help her or is she just trying to manipulate me? 

Edit: just wanted to add more info about my friend as it may influence the overall opinion of her. She grew up in foster care and aged out at 18. She's had the same case worker since who has helped her with housing in the past. She sees her caseworker about once every few months. Also she has a high school diploma and is / was a licensed massage therapist. But said she couldn't renew her license due to financial reasons and sorta just fell off and hasn't been back up since.

The real reason he was late getting there was because he stayed up until 3am doing dumb shit and overslept. He didn't leave my grandfather's place until some to 12pm. My fiance and Grandpa were over at a friend of my grandpa's helping him weed eat and now his yard since 9:45am. His tires were fine when he left the house. 

I didn't even hear anything about this until Tuesday morning when this family member began to cuss me and berate me for getting married finally. I blocked them after they called me a few choice names, but they have been harassing me through other accounts.  I've been blocking them and moving on. We both, after finding that my brother told this lie, decided to uninvite/ban my brother from our wedding. 

My brother however asked me today if I would send him our wedding registry and I told him he wasn't welcome to attend our wedding. Cue to insanity of him complaining to our mom (he's her golden child) about how I'm being a b-word and refusing to let him be at our wedding. My moms response to me was ""can't you two just get along for once?"" This is her usual guilt trip for me to cave and sweep my brother's BS under the rug. 

I said no and we are sticking to our guns about him not being welcome. I have since been labeled an Asshole for not wanting him there over ""petty drama"" and ""nonsense"" by many family members and mutual friends. 

Am I really an asshole for not wanting him there after this? Should I just let it go and let him come?
 

ETA: I have seen a couple comments claiming I just blocked the person and didn't defend my fiance. I actually went off on this particular family member as I knew it was a lie and I defended my fiance. 

ETA 2: as stated in a comment, my brother and I do not get along and have not gotten along since he caused me to have a stroke three years ago after tampering with my meds. He and my fiance have not gotten along since right after they met basically when my brother destroyed a priceless heirloom that was from my late grandma while he was drunk and my fiance kicked him out of our place.

1l5qr2p,AITA for Refusing to Sleep on a Twin Mattress on the Floor While Visiting My Girlfriend Who Lives in Another State?,LostProblem9144,AmItheAsshole,199,413,1749318549.0,"I (21M) am visiting my girlfriend (21F) of 6 months, over the weekend in another state, we have a good relationship and don‚Äôt argue much, and I like to think we are both agreeable so we usually resolve issues before they become a problem. And we both believe this was a stupid argument so I‚Äôm really just looking for other opinions. I also should mention my build, I am 6‚Äô and 200 pounds, I‚Äôd say above average build but nothing crazy, however quite bigger than anyone else in the story.

I flew in a couple days ago to stay with my GF and her family. Her parents don‚Äôt want us sleeping in the same room which isn‚Äôt a problem, plus she usually sneaks in late at night for a little bit. The plan was I would sleep in her bed and she would sleep in a siblings room. Flash forward to the second night, everything is going well and we decide to go out with a friend who we will call Jen (not her real name) and Jen‚Äôs guy. Before we left for the bar Jen mentioned sleeping over, on the couch, but I never really paid much attention to the comment (I guess this was when the upcoming situation was decided). We have fun out at the bars but decide to head home, and I know she gets emotional when she drinks (a bit more than sober). Jen‚Äôs guy goes home to his house, and the three of us get a Lyft home. We get home and I go to get in the bed that I was meant to sleep in and they tell me I need to sleep on a twin sized mattress on the floor. I protest saying that wasn‚Äôt the plan and how that‚Äôs not comfortable. I‚Äôm tired and just want to go to bed. Everyone is trying to convince me how comfortable it is but I know that I‚Äôm too big for it and I won‚Äôt be comfortable. Not to mention I flew here and me sleeping on the twin mattress on the floor was not the plan. I was called a diva and I‚Äôll admit in hindsight that I was dramatic. The argument continues as everyone clears out and it‚Äôs just me and GF, and she says that if it was her she would just take the twin sized mattress and that I wasn‚Äôt being the gentleman that I should be. I finally conceded and grabbed the twin bed and dragged it to GF‚Äôs room to sleep on it. I was then told by my GF it was too late and that the damage is done, and I have ruined everyones mood, and sleeping on the twin is no longer an option. We argue bit more and after a while I just decided that I needed to blow off steam so I took a brief walk and called a buddy to vent off the issue, and he agreed with me saying it wasn‚Äôt fair considering I flew here and that they are changing plans. I take a second and then go back inside and we both agree to disagree and sleep it off until the morning when we are thinking clearly. We ended up sleeping in the big bed, and Jen with one of GF‚Äôs sisters. When we wake up we both apologize and agree it was immature, but we still disagree on the outcome. We put it behind us and we are past it, I am writing this on the following day, and I‚Äôm not necessarily looking validation, I believe I was being dramatic, but AITA?"
1l542ki,"AITA for not bringing my niece shopping after she was extremely rude/mean to me, even if she ‚Äúapologized‚Äù?",exbfandmycat,AmItheAsshole,11332,2087,1749245476.0,"I do not have kids, and I also have not really had a lot of experience dealing with kids before my niece. I don‚Äôt have younger siblings or cousins, I never babysat, etc. I‚Äôm explaining this because this is my blind spot and why I‚Äôm posting.

About a month ago, my niece ‚ÄúGabby‚Äù and I were at the park together. I like to spend time with her and usually take her out to do things just the two of us every couple of weeks. While we were at the park, I was talking about an event I am going to attend with my boyfriend of a few years. She asked to see my dress, so I showed her a pic of me in it.

She made a ‚Äúyucky‚Äù face and said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs soooooooo ugly. You look really fat. Isn‚Äôt \[\[my boyfriend\]\] gonna think it's bad?‚Äù

I was so hurt. She‚Äôs only 13! I‚Äôm not even a big girl in any sense. I have fat on my body, but I am definitely not fat. 

My sister was surprised and said she would talk to her. A few days later she had Gabby come over to apologize. From my POV, it was not sincere. She was rolling her eyes and looked angry and just got out the words. I told her thank you for apologizing and then told them to leave. I have not gone out my way to spend time with her since.

I had told Gabby that I would take her shopping for the summer and we‚Äôd pick out fun stuff together. I look forward to doing things like this with her. Not really anymore. When we were at my mom‚Äôs house for mother‚Äôs day, Gabby asked me when we would go.

After her stunt I‚Äôve changed my mind. I said that she probably has plenty of summer clothes to wear. She was upset and said ‚ÄúBut I said I was sorry!‚Äù over and over. 

I told her that I know she said she was sorry but just because someone says they‚Äôre sorry to you doesn‚Äôt mean that your actions are forgiven. That you have to prove to the other person you won‚Äôt do it again, and she hasn‚Äôt. 

My mom and sister say I‚Äôm expecting adult behavior from a child and that it was ridiculous to cancel the shopping date. I am apparently beefing with a child at my big age. They said that she apologized and hasn‚Äôt said anything else rude to me since. They asked how long I‚Äôm going to hold it against her. 

I really don‚Äôt know how to take this. I trust their judgment most of the time. But this was just an outright mean thing from her. I am worried that as she grows up this behavior will continue and she will turn out to be a bully. AITA?"
1l5dhm0,AITA for how I responded to my nanny kid‚Äôs camp calling,aitasickcall,AmItheAsshole,1446,107,1749274852.0,"I‚Äôm a nanny to a 6 year old boy and 2 year old girl. The job has gotten more complicated over the past year due to the parents divorcing. I work for the mom on her weeks and I occasionally help the dad out when his mom can‚Äôt watch the kids. The job is pretty great though. The mom and I have become good friends and I love the kids. 

The 6 year old got out of school 2 weeks ago and is in camp now. The thing with camp is, he tends to be over it by 2-3ish so I get a lot of calls ‚Äúhe has a stomach ache‚Äù ‚Äúhis head hurts‚Äù ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not feeling well‚Äù where he acts sick until we go home, then he‚Äôs bouncing off the walls and jumping on the couch. We‚Äôve talked multiple times about it. There‚Äôs no problem with any staff or other kids. He‚Äôs just over it. 

I was on vacation all week. Yesterday I got a call from the camp and when I answered the kid started telling me that he hit his lip on a table that morning and a mosquito bit him on the playground so now his arm hurts and he wants to go home. I talked to him about his day for a minute, reminded him that I was on vacation and wouldn‚Äôt be able to hop on a plane to pick him up, then talked to the counselor to make sure there weren‚Äôt any serious issues. Hung up, texted the mom to let her know about the call, and went about my day. 

Then last night the dad started texting me furious that I dismissed his ‚Äúinjury‚Äù, reminded me about his (extremely mild) mosquito allergy (counselor already said someone at camp gave him his Zyrtec so he‚Äôs absolutely fine), and thinks I should‚Äôve contacted him, his mom, or asked the kids mom to get him after the camp called me. 

The mom told me not to worry about it but I know the kid already does have anxiety issues so I‚Äôm wondering if I did something wrong by telling him he‚Äôd have to tough it out until his parents could get him and not contacting someone to pick him up. "
1l582kv,AITA for only taking care of my (full) little sister,AdvanceFlimsy2383,AmItheAsshole,3458,340,1749256586.0,"I (30M) have a younger sister (16F), Lara. I‚Äôve basically raised this girl like my daughter. I love her like she‚Äôs my own child. Our mom died when Lara was a year old, I was 15. Our father was a wealthy man with a revolving door of younger women, who my sister grew up resenting. Whatever our father was, he loved us both very much. He was a workaholic, which left me caring for my sister most of the time. Even though she had a nanny, she had extreme separation anxiety.

When I started college, our father bought me an apartment so I didn‚Äôt have to stay in a dorm. It turned into me raising my sister throughout college and business school. She stayed at my apartment with her nanny during school hours, and I took care of her when I came home. I never missed a single competition or spelling bee, even through school, which I don‚Äôt regret. That‚Äôs what I mean when I say I raised her.

About three years ago, our father started dating a much younger woman (25F). She got pregnant and gave birth to a daughter. I was never involved with the kid. One time, I took my sister to visit because our father requested it. It ended with her being an emotionally distraught mess for a week. She felt like she was being ‚Äúreplaced.‚Äù Any time I brought up the kid, she would cry. So I refused to see the kid again.

Our father died unexpectedly six months ago. He never married the woman, and she didn‚Äôt get a penny in the will. The kid got a small lump sum, but nothing like the trusts my sister and I received. I don‚Äôt think he cared for the kid very much, but the woman wanted it. I used to joke to my sister that the girl was just a ‚Äúcompromise kid.‚Äù

Lately, the woman has started badgering me. She says she can‚Äôt raise a child on her own and it‚Äôs unfair that I‚Äôm protective of my sister but won‚Äôt do the same for my ‚Äúother sibling.‚Äù I corrected her and said I had no relation or obligation to her child. Her child being around hurts my sister, and she is my priority. She got angry and said I can‚Äôt spoil one sister and neglect another. She said her child doesn‚Äôt have a father now and needs a male presence. I told her to contact my lawyer.

Then she somehow got my sister‚Äôs number and sent her texts calling her cruel for ‚Äúkeeping‚Äù me away. I had to be up all night consoling my sister, telling her I wouldn‚Äôt see this girl and she had nothing to worry about. I called the woman again and threatened legal action if she kept harassing my sister. Now she‚Äôs calling my aunts and uncles, saying I‚Äôm vindictive and cruel.

Two women will create arrangements and set them on the table for customers to pick from. A man asked me if he could purchase a lime green succulent bowl placed on the table. I of course said yes, as I have done this countless times before with other arrangements from the table. Three hours go by and I‚Äôm radioed to come to the registers. A woman shows me a picture of the exact same pot I had previously sold to the man earlier. I instantly tell her the truth and that I was not aware that pot belonged to her. She begins crying hysterically. She walks to her car and cries for five minutes. She comes back and I tell her to take her other two pots for free and apologize profusely. I call the store owner and ask him what we can do to fix this and he tells me no calls can be made at the moment because the banks were closed. There was no way to call and get the man‚Äôs credit card information. She was so hysterical I couldn‚Äôt explain this to her or get her number before she drove off. The following day (today) I open in the garden center and she drove by to speak with the owner. We locked eyes and I started walking over to speak with her. I wanted to tell her I‚Äôm sorry again and that we think the man who purchased the pot tampered with the tags as it shouldn‚Äôt have had a price on it if it belonged to a larger set of three. As soon as I start walking over to her, she scoffs at me, throws her hand up, and says ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt‚Äù. I feel bad, yes, but what else could I have done here? The woman who potted the plants said a man matching the description I had asked her 30 minutes before she left if he could purchase that pot and was told no.

One day they were over and one of my friends that they have yet to meet until that day was over as well . My other friend who did not give me the artwork looked up the art pieces through Google lens because they also liked them and wanted to get some for themselves. 

That friend found out that the artwork that was given to me was worth $1000 per piece . And I said wow, that‚Äôs an insane price. So the friend who gave me the art pieces told me that I needed to give them back to him. And he started taking him off the wall and I said absolutely not. You gave those to me. 

He started yelling at me because I wouldn‚Äôt give them back. Then he said I better pay him $3000 for all of them and I said no because you gifted them to me almost a year ago. 

So he told me that he was gonna call the police and he left because me and my other friend kicked him out.

I can barely remember it being a thing but we were so young it didn‚Äôt have too much impact in the long run. 

We‚Äôve never spoken to him except as we were growing up he‚Äôd follow us on socials and would try to start conversations with awkward Happy Birthdays we entertained him until he tried to ask for money one time so we kinda ignored him since. 

I don‚Äôt think anybody in our family has really kept up with him including our Dad except maybe our Aunt who‚Äôd give us random updates about him here and there pretty sure he‚Äôs 23 or 24

Anyway my Dad has unfortunately passed somewhat unexpectedly but he was an older guy, don‚Äôt want to get into it tbh. But It‚Äôs been about 4 months since and me and my sister have been staying at his house that‚Äôs passed to us and figuring all the other stuff out 

We recently got a formal letter from the HB‚Äôs lawyer (which I‚Äôm pretty sure is just his friend but that‚Äôs besides the point) asking for his portion of everything, so we were practically forced to meet with him where he gave us a sob story about how he needed help and a place to stay or he‚Äôd take us to court. So basically forcing our hand to make a choice soon.

I think it‚Äôs ridiculous to let a stranger basically into our home and lives like this but the alternative is selling everything if we were forced to give him stuff. My aunt says I‚Äôm being an asshole and that he‚Äôs no different from a distant relative at worst but I feel like he has bad intentions or something and honestly I think it‚Äôs wrong for him to swoop in and lay claim to a place he‚Äôs never step foot in and ask help from people he dosent even know I bet he‚Äôs been waiting for this for a while now.

We had plans for her to visit again for an extended period of time.

My friends have expressed their discomfort with me. We are forced to have extremely surface level shallow conversations during lunch because we scared of her gossiping to her friends. It‚Äôs hard because lunch is the only time we see each other.

1l5p3jx,AITAH for no longer wanting to deal with my biological father and step mother.,PoohdaBrattt,AmItheAsshole,77,33,1749314320.0,"Long story alert!!!! Let‚Äôs go back to 2022, I (24F) decided i wanted to become a police officer. I was 21 then. I went to the academy and approximately the 12th week of academy, My Corporals told the class we would have 10 tickets for visitors. I initially invited my brothers, both of my biological parents, best friend, aunties and my grandmother before she passed away. Maybe around the 13th week, I had to drop from 10 tickets to 5. So I chose my parents, my two bothers and my best friend. 

My dad felt as if my step mother should have been included in the five tickets because of the things she has done for me and my brothers as far as stuff for the house that me and my second oldest brother share. The things she has done was supposed to been done before they got married before anyway. So to me, it feels like entitlement to the ticket for my police graduation. So because i stood 10 toes down behind who i chose for my tickets. I decided to have a dinner after the graduation where everyone would be invited and it could still be a celebration.

Me and my father had an argument and he told me that he would not be attending my graduation if my step mother was not invited. I made arrangements that if someone in my academy class wouldn‚Äôt use all his tickets that he would let me have his last one and my step mom would have one. I guess that was not good enough for my dad. He felt as if my step mom should‚Äôve been included in the 5 whether or not if i got the extra ticket or not. Graduation came and gone and he did not show. And yes, It hurt me alot, he missed an important milestone and he cant go back and fix it. I can say it has drawn a wedge between us. I used to be a daddy‚Äôs girl, OVERLY. I wasnt doing anything without my dad.

Fast for to 2025, The wedge has gotten worse. I dont ask my dad for anything, I dont expect anything, we could really go weeks without talking. Here it is May/June and I recently had a surgery and my dad felt he wasn‚Äôt inclined in that because i chose to let my mom take care of me instead of my stepmom who is actually a nurse. I do not have a relationship with neither him nor her now stemming from my graduation. He did call and check on me.. At some point during my surgery, my mom and my dad had a FULL come apart and my graduation came up. My dad made the statement to my mom that if he could go back and do it order, he would do it the same. That hurt me to find out after my surgery.

1l59xme,AITA for throwing away a plate of food over relish?,uelvet,AmItheAsshole,1061,479,1749262508.0,"I (25F) was invited to have dinner with my parents. We were having a simple dinner of hamburgers and hotdogs on the grill. Fries, chips, you know, the classics. After everything was prepared and cooked, we set it all up on the counter as grab and go bar. Lettuce, onions, tomatoes, chili, and...relish. 

Now, I love pickles, but I really don't like relish. I had it once and it hurt my stomach so I just don't eat it. I don't like it, so I don't eat it. simple. I'm not a picky eater either, I just don't waste time eating foods I know I don't or won't like. I'm open to trying foods, but not anything I know I won't like. Example, I don't like seafood so I don't try different fish. I don't care to eat any type of seafood, so I don't even bother.

I'll give some preface here, my dad is the type to try and get someone to try something, specifically me. He's always telling me, ""you need to just try it"", ""try it for me"", ""why won't you just try it?"", and so on. It really gets on my nerves and frustrates me because I don't know why he won't just let it go. We've gotten into arguments over foods I refused to be pressured into trying or eating. I'm not going to eat something I don't like or know I won't like. 

At dinner while I'm putting my preferred toppings on my burger, my dad approaches me with a jar of homemade relish. I already knew what was coming. He put a little bit on a spoon and said ""try this, it's homemade."" I politely declined as I tried to continue making my plate. He then proceeded with ""come on, just try it."" I told him flat out no. I could tell he was getting frustrated with me as he put the spoon closer to me. ""Why won't you just try it?"" He said. I looked at him and with a bit of anger in my tone, I said, ""I'm not going to try it. I don't like relish."" He then proceeded to say, ""You haven't had homemade relish. It will change your mind."" I was growing a lot more angry at this point because I don't know why it's such a big ideal. Why he's determined to make me try things I don't want. 

I finally just said loudly that I'm not going to eat the relish. He began arguing with me saying he doesn't understand why I'm getting so angry and frustrated. 

He then proceeded to put a glob of relish on my burger and tell me I need to try something for once. This angered me. Now, I'm not the type to waste food and I know I could have just scraped it off and made my burger again, but I was fuming at this point. I decided to throw my entire plate of food in the trash. This prompted an argument of me ""wasting food"" and ""overreacting."" I wasn't going to stay and put up with the overwhelming arguments so I just left afterwards.

1l5q7mp,"AITA? Bf (33m) is very upset with me (33f) over not agreeing to get pricey gift, I don‚Äôt think I should be expected to. Am I the ahole here?",Devynhale92,AmItheAsshole,62,129,1749317173.0,"I‚Äôm going to try and keep this as to the point as I can. Basically me and my bf have been dating for almost 2 years and live together. He has an almost 5 year old son with another woman. I‚Äôve met his child and we 3 occasionally will do things together. Essentially, I‚Äôve been around his kid plenty but he does not live with us. His son lives with the mother full time. Last year on Father‚Äôs Day, I didn‚Äôt say happy Father‚Äôs Day or acknowledge it at all. Not for any reason, I just genuinely didn‚Äôt think to. He‚Äôs not my father and we don‚Äôt have a child together. It just didn‚Äôt register for me at all. Again, not in any malicious way. 

Afterwards he told me he was pretty upset by this. Fast forward to now and we recently had an argument about how in the wrong I was and I did admit I was wrong and should have acknowledged it. He started going on about wanting this one gift that would benefit both of us and was $70. He said he would even throw in 20. After arguing about if I‚Äôm obligated or ‚Äúshould‚Äù get him a gift for Father‚Äôs Day I conceded to getting this one gift as a Father‚Äôs Day gift for him. 
THEN, a couple days later he sends me a link for $130 tool he wanted and said I should get that as a Father‚Äôs Day gift. He even found one on eBay for $100. I said ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs pretty expensive for a Father‚Äôs Day gift‚Ä¶.. he lost his shit. 
Telling me I‚Äôm selfish, I only think of myself etc etc. that if I wasn‚Äôt getting that he would throw anything I did get in the trash. Saying it was not expensive. That Father‚Äôs Day is the only holiday he cares about and is more important than his bday Xmas etc. that he didn‚Äôt care if I didn‚Äôt get anything for those holiday‚Äôs, this is the only one that‚Äôs matters. (Even though I‚Äôve already spent plenty of $ on those days and I am pretty sure he WOULD care if I got nothing on his bday.) 

My point of view is that nothing should be expected other than a happy Father‚Äôs Day and maybe a card. Anything more would be nice but def shouldn‚Äôt be an expectation. There‚Äôs no obligation for me to go all out on this day in my eyes. And honestly, Father‚Äôs Day to me just isn‚Äôt a holiday you go all out and spend a bunch of $ for. I only ever got my own father simple inexpensive gifts. Just like Valentine‚Äôs Day, I don‚Äôt expect a big gift. This feels on par with that holiday to me. And honestly just his whole attitude of ‚Äú buy me this pricey gift or your SELFISH and I‚Äôll throw anything else in the TRASH‚Äù is insane to me! I would never ever act like that or say that to him, for any occasion. And for context I‚Äôm not a mother. 

Anyway yesterday we got on the topic again and had a screaming match over it. He then proceeded to tell me I do nothing for him and a list of other hurtful things. Which could not be farther from the truth but ok. Am I being unreasonable ? Or is he? Someone tell me."

Good to see all of you here UwU.

Grab on to your bodypillows, I have a smol announcement about the purpose of this subreddit. 

This community is meant as a fun, lighthearted place where we can commiserate with each other about those annoying little irritations that hinder our day to day enjoyment in life.

That  means that suitable posts here can be about my children. 

And things like a wall socket or tile being placed out of allignment. A crack in a phone screen. Duckling shit on your new car. Incomprehensible software. Mismatched buttons. You know, the little things. 

This subreddit isn't meant to incite rage mobs that go after people. For that reason we say:

#No reddit meta posts

No posts about being banned from subreddit. No posts about up- or down-votes. No posts about shitty moderators or users or subreddits. No posts about reddit. 

All jokes and tomfoolery aside, that sort of thing gets us in trouble with site admins. If we allow one type of post about reddit it then very easily moprhs into allowing posts that directly call out other subreddits or users, we just can't allow any of it. 

That rule already existed for years and we have just made it more clearly visible in the sidebar on old and new reddit. We're gonna be a little strict on it for a bit I'm afraid. ü•∫

Thank you all for being awesome and have a very Merry Christmas! Celebrate Christmas in the traditional European way, with a suasage roll!

1l5ou5w,Took my car to the dealership. Got mocked for my name.,chy27,mildlyinfuriating,4138,786,1749313642.0,"My name is Chyna (China). I hate it. Always have. Anyways, took my car into the dealership for an oil change. Guy that I checked in with sees my name and the first thing he says while full on laughing is ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not Asian.‚Äù (We‚Äôre both white). I glared at him in silence. Then made a comment about my height as I‚Äôm short. He then apologizes and says he‚Äôs bored. Didn‚Äôt know boredom was an excuse to be racist üôÑ 

Takes me back to when I was 4-5 years old sitting in the waiting room at a dealership with my mom. I was playing with my little ponies quietly in a chair across from my mom. CNN was on, talking about some issue with China at the time. Another woman in the waiting room started ranting about how horrible China is and how much she hates China. I slowly moved myself to the floor and inched my way across until I was hugging my mom‚Äôs legs. She finally looked down at me and said ‚ÄúHoney she‚Äôs not talking about you.‚Äù Then woman was horrified when she realized what my name was and apologized profusely. 

Anyways, this has been a PSA to not name your kid after a country üôÉ I promise you I have heard every joke in the book, and no they‚Äôre not funny. 

ETA: for those arguing if it‚Äôs racist, the follow up comment was that at least I was short. Regardless, it‚Äôs unprofessional and mildly infuriating. 

ETA 2: why don‚Äôt I change my name? Too expensive and a hassle, I‚Äôm already well established with that name. I have a career and assets, it‚Äôs not that simple. My parents also threatened to cut contact with me if I did, as they‚Äôre offended. I go by a nickname socially but as this was official documentation it had my first name. I was not named after the wrestler but the singer Chynna Phillips."

Well‚Ä¶not for long.

Shortly after, another panelist replies to that email CC‚Äôing everyone, including me (the applicant) and says:

‚ÄúBart is out. Lisa is not the authority on this matter. Cancel the request to Bart and apologize.‚Äù

‚Ä¶and yes, Lisa is the one who actually seemed to like me during the interview. And she was also cc‚Äôd in this email, telling her that her opinion didn‚Äôt matter. So I guess I got the boot and a live show of their messy internal drama.

I knew some people in the panel had reservations, but this? Come on. If your team can‚Äôt even handle email coordination or basic professionalism in a hiring process why would I want to work there?

We've recently seen a lot more people responding in character. That's great! We love it!

We've also seen an uptick in people using generative AI such as Chat GPT to explain the joke. We know these posts don't mean any harm, but it diminishes the effort of other people actually taking the time to write out their own answer to the post, and is often *just plainly wrong*. 

From here on out, we'll be removing comments using generative AI in the same way we currently remove other botted comments. Because copying and pasting from GPT is just a bot with extra steps.

While we're talking about AI: AI memes aren't banned here. Comments like ""this is AI slop"" are also being added to the remove list for being low effort/borderline whooshing.

Edit: Also there is no rule that people have to respond in character. We just really encourage it and love to see it since that‚Äôs how the sub got its start. Remember Rule 1 and don‚Äôt be a dick to people who aren‚Äôt responding in character. 

Keep up the great work with the in-character responses, chums! Mayor Adam West's ghost out! By climbing up the side of a building by filming it sideways! This is how we did that! Bet you didn't know!"

# [Cow Tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/comments/141u2cj/go_ahead_explain_it/)

Per u/[cthulhuscradle](https://www.reddit.com/user/cthulhuscradle/): The creator of the comic confirmed that the joke is ""if cows made tools they probably wouldn't be very good""

# [Genie increasing earth's gravity](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/comments/1j4oqfe/can_peter_help/)

Per u/[Nearby-Actuary-3835](/user/Nearby-Actuary-3835/): There was an earlier post by someone else on the same sub that went ""when I'm about to enjoy a watermelon but gravity suddenly increases"". With a gif of someone cracking a watermelon with their head. This is a funny follow up/reference to that post that explains how that happened

# [Guy named Ice](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainTheJoke/comments/1e0pu48/ice/)

Per u/HorseStupid: It's a [""Kid Named Finger""](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/kid-named-finger) type meme, where the punchline is irreverent to the set up.

A joke that may be the original for this punchline may be like, ""Crush: All I want is Ice Cream / Guy named Ice:""

# [Philosophy people disproportionately look like evil villains](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/comments/16jdnra/wut/)

Per u/ThenaCykez: Peter here! The character at bottom is Chidi from *The Good Place*, a philosophy professor who has died and entered the afterlife. He has severe anxiety and indecisiveness. As in the picture, he gets a stomachache whenever he has to make an important decision because it takes him hours as he considers his philosophical principles. Spoiler:Although he thinks he is in heaven (""the good place""), he later learns he is actually in hell (""the bad place"") because his overthinking had made everyone in his life miserable, and he never did anything good with his [life.So](http://life.So) maybe OP is saying ""You're not going to like the answer: most philosophers ARE villains.""

# [Time machine wolves in captivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeterExplainsTheJoke/comments/1iseurc/petah/)

u/[0xKaishakunin](/user/0xKaishakunin/) with the explanation: That's Lucyan David Mech, who die research on wolves and came up with the term ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù and ‚Äúalpha female‚Äù and the theory that wolves live in a strict hierarchy, where the alphas constatnly attack lower ranking wolves.

This has inspired the alpha male/incel bullshit that spreads nowadays.

1l4t34l,AITAH for banning users with scam links and other domains mostly bots use?,sn34kypete,AITAH,39,27,1749218266.0,"Hello AITAH community!

Since our head mod began recruiting efforts a few months ago, we've expanded our moderation team and increased our toolkit to try to give you the best experience this sub can offer. Our last mod announcement was unfortunately on April 1st but we assure you our efforts are not a joke. We care about this community and want to see the quality in this community continue to improve.

Here are a few changes we've implemented over the last few months since the new team came on:

Automod: We actually use it now! We're banning social media links, scam links, amazon links, anything that can be used to monetize or self-promote has been banned. We also try to filter out those oh-so-real posts about making it big on gambling sites and we continually adjust the filter on hot topics. Nobody needs rage bait, right? Additionally we get warnings if a post or comment gets too many reports. Reports are important, this will be a theme in the post.

Rules: Rules have been refined and expounded upon. You may have noticed some comments removed for name calling or incivility. Reports from users really help us find these (theme). We have put the rules in the sidebar, the new.reddit sidebar, and the wiki. No matter how you reddit, the new rules are there, you should see them and maybe take a moment to review them. If we were to undergo anything more drastic than common sense rule changes, we will announce them in a post and sticky it.

We've also added automated tools against ban evasion, bots, karma farmers, and scammers. None of these are perfect, obviously, but they have managed to catch some of the repeat trolls, lower-quality bots, and most of the ""AITAH for looking too hot in my bikini? link to my OF here btw"" posts. If you get caught in one of these, the initial modmail should contain instructions on how to reverse it, otherwise reach out and we will investigate.

A specific note about one of these tools: it checks links in your profile and your activity on specific karma-farming subreddits. We do not police regular subreddit usage, you will never see us ban you for posting in ""normal"" subreddits such as sports, your city subreddit, or even political subs. We only ban participants in karma farming or scammer-oriented subs. We also don't ban normal social links - your FB, Insta, etc. are all fine. We ban links where people could give you money - both SFW ones like Venmo and CashApp and NSFW ones. If you need these links in your profile, you can make an alt account without the links, and we will ignore Reddit's ban evasion warnings if you let us know. We can't sort out the real enterprising users who frequent this sub from those that are owners of hundreds of bots, and we won't attempt the effort or the botfarm owners would just appeal the bans. We are not anti-sex worker or anti-entrepreneur, we are anti bots. Blame the bots or yell at us and take a perma.

Report alerts (theme): We get bat-signals for reports now. Please, please use reports appropriately and not as a super-downvote. If a comment or post gets enough reports, we at least lay eyes on them and discuss internally. We have modmail, we have a chat group. We don't only look at reported posts, but reporting them makes them much more visible to us. We've seen the shittiest ragebait barely garner 3 reports on something with 2k karma, and there will be 50 comments calling it fake. We need your reports, we use them. Please report responsibly and we'll do our part, we know mods have been less responsive in the past but our mod team has grown and so has our response team. Please report personal attacks and AI slop, we hate both. A note on the custom report feature - this can be helpful to note previous posts by OP, or a link to an old post they obviously copied from, but sometimes it is less helpful. We can mute reports from someone if they make unhelpful custom reports, and if that happens too often we will disable that feature.

These automations come with collateral damage. We get people who got hacked and had those links put in their profile. We get software devs who just leave an open hand asking for a coffee if you appreciate their efforts. We get people who mostly post in local city subs looking to pawn off their wares. We get bots. Like a lot of bots. Like holy shit a lot of them. The ban to complaint ratio is still very good but every morning the moderation team wakes up to appeals because xXSweetCherryXx, an account made 19 hours ago, can't post here any more because ""she"" has links to OF, paypal, and/or fansly (this is not a comprehensive example, it's a lot more) on her profile. If we didn't ban them then, they'd be banned in a dozen days after making some AI shitpost and then shitting up other subs spamming their AI onlyfans content.

We put these restrictions in place to allow the most common contributor to the sub to persist. The ""This is a throwaway, here is my real story"" user. We can put in account age limits, but the bots use abandoned reddit profiles, the bot owners are also patient. We can put in karma requirements, but the bots karma farm in karma farm subs or no-karma-required subs. We cannot impose limitations that do not adversely affect the real contributions to this subreddit. So instead we added the automated tools. It's the best solution we have now while leaving the door open to genuine throwaways. If the community is so sick of the fake posts that you want us to try these anyway, please let us know and we will try to implement this in a way that minimizes the collateral to real throwaways.

Our final say is the tools do more good than harm, much to the dismay of our more entrepreneurial posters who are real people. We have actually been repeatedly asked by mods of other major subreddits to implement some of these tools, since they notice the shitposters build up their karma minimums here. It is the mod team's opinion that this policy is a largely net good, but we want to remain transparent as we implement broader changes to the sub.

So reddit, AITAH for adding apps to block scam links, auto-hide comments with a ton of reports, and block users who have links that are commonly associated with scams?"
1l5gp6r,AITA for not taking my father's minor children into consideration when I sued him for the inheritance he stole from me?,ComplaintNatural5528,AITAH,11440,1519,1749287953.0,"My mom died when I (22f) was 10 and in her will she left me an inheritance of more than 100k. My dad was left in charge of it but after he remarried, him and his wife wanted to start a business together and they used the money mom left me to open it. Dad and I argued about it at the time but I was 15 and he kept insisting it was good for the whole family and how it was better used to help everyone than being thrown away on random shit when I turned 18.

Our relationship was over before I moved out of his house at 18. I had made his and his wife's life miserable for stealing from me and once I was out of there I looked into how I could get that money back. I pressed charges against him for stealing from me and I sued him for the money. I had the support of my entire extended family on my maternal side and some on my paternal side. But I was told by others on the paternal side to consider my dad's other kids and the devastation that kind if financial upheaval could bring. I ignored those comments. I knew waiting would prevent me from ever getting the money and I honestly did not care about his family's financial security after being stolen from.

It was a long ass process and I needed to return to court a few times because he was just like I can't pay, I don't have the money anymore. In the end they were forced to give up the business and it was sold to pay me the money back and he had to pay additional out of his paycheck which made him empty their savings so his wages weren't garnished anymore.

By the time I got it back I was 100% done and past the point where we could ever reconcile. He made me fight so hard for what was legally mine and he stole money mom left to support his new family.

My relationship with some of dad's side is not so strong anymore and they think it was wrong that I focused only on what he did and not on the effects for the kids. I mostly don't talk to those family members now but they asked me how I feel zero guilt for it when the kids are innocent and are still my siblings technically. That they would have thought I'd want better for them.

I don't feel bad. I never have. But AITA for not taking the kids into consideration? Is that something I should have done? I feel like that's just really unfair to me and locks me into never being paid back. I don't think I owe those kids that. "
1l5nz6g,AITA for secretly replacing my late brother's ashes with fireplace ash so I could keep the real ones?,-Ammonia-,AITAH,2475,302,1749311422.0,"My brother passed away two years ago. We were incredibly close , he basically raised me after our parents died. He had always said he didn‚Äôt want to be buried or scattered; he wanted to ‚Äústay with the people he loved.‚Äù When he passed, the family decided to scatter his ashes at our childhood home‚Äôs lake. I was devastated ,I wanted to keep a small urn, but my older cousin (who organized the memorial) said that was ‚Äúmorbid and selfish‚Äù and insisted all the ashes be scattered together. Everyone else went along with it.

Here‚Äôs where it gets weird.

I work at a lab, and I quietly took a small portion of his ashes home before the official scattering. To avoid suspicion, I replaced what I took with a near-identical weight of gray fireplace ash. No one noticed. I now have a tiny urn in my apartment, and I feel closer to him because of it.

I told my best friend recently, and she was horrified. She said it was deceptive, disrespectful to the rest of the family, and possibly even ‚Äúspiritually selfish.‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt thought of it like that. I never meant to hurt anyone ,it just felt like my only way to keep a piece of him with me.

So‚Ä¶ AITA for secretly replacing some of my brother‚Äôs ashes before the family scattered them?"
1l5s5hs,AITAH for telling my husband I already knew that he cheated on me,LotrTHGhpDivergent,AITAH,1262,591,1749322143.0,"A week and a half ago I was on his phone to order something on Amazon. There was a notification from a number I didn‚Äôt recognize. I clicked on it and there were months worth of flirty texts, inappropriate pictures and she even asked him to come to her apartment a few times. 

I knew I couldn‚Äôt stay with him because he was a cheater, obviously, but I couldn‚Äôt break things off immediately. We have 3 kids together (a 5yo, a 1yo and a 2 month old) I don‚Äôt want him to get the kids but we signed a prenup bc he had some money he wanted to protect. I was scared that a judge would give him custody bc he can afford to take care of them better but the prenup had a clause where it‚Äôs dissolved if he‚Äôs unfaithful. 

I wasn‚Äôt going to do anything crazy. I just wanted to find a lawyer before mentioning anything to him. But yesterday he told me about the cheating and apologized. I told him I knew about it already. He got mad at me for not telling him sooner. He told me that I‚Äôm ruining our family by keeping secrets from him. Like okay hypocrite much? But anyways now I‚Äôm also wondering if I should forgive him since he came clean. I still want our kids to grow up normal. I don‚Äôt want a broken home for them. If he was willing to tell me and to apologize, could we still make things work?

AITAH for not telling him I knew sooner? WIBTAH if I still divorce him after he told me about it? "
1l5it7u,AITA for giving the concert ticket I promised to my dad to someone else after I found out he was planning to take my stepsister with us?,Easy-Swing5166,AITAH,2965,240,1749296384.0,"My parents have been divorced most of my life and I had a good relationship with dad until I was 11. That's when he remarried and I felt like he prioritized his stepkids but mostly his stepdaughter who's my age. Suddenly he was showing up less to stuff like my hockey games and he was always cheering me on at those. Any plans we made he'd try to bring his stepdaughter into and he'd ask me why I wasn't doing more to bond with her. He didn't care as much about me bonding with his stepson but it was like his stepdaughter was all he cared about.

Sometimes he ruined the few moments we had together by saying how much he wished she was there with us. Or he'd answer calls when he didn't answer calls when he was with them.

I started going to his house less. I'm 16 so I can choose that as long as I still go some of the time. Dad was like I miss you, why don't you come every other week like you used to and I told him why. He asked me why I was acting like I hated his stepdaughter. I told him I didn't hate her but I don't want to include her in our time. I told him I don't want to feel like I come in second and like he doesn't care so much now. He asked me how he cares more about his stepkids. I said he goes to all his stepson's football games and he goes to all his stepdaughter's competitions and recitals. He doesn't even go to half of mine anymore when he used to. And I told him he stays to watch them practice but never comes to mine. Then I brought up the phone calls and how if anyone calls while he's with me he answers but if he's with them he mutes his phone. I told him I deserved the same level of consideration.

I told him to leave me alone since he wanted to fight with me on it. And things were so tense for a few weeks. He then apologized to me and said he wanted to make it up to me and he asked if I'd give him the second concert ticket I got for my birthday and take him and we can have the day to ourselves. I asked him if that meant just him and me and he said yes. He said he was sorry to have made me feel that way and he never wanted me to feel less important. So I told him he could have the other ticket and we'd go together. I didn't give it to him though and now I'm glad because last week I found out he bought a ticket so his stepdaughter could come with us. Dad got mad at me because I got crying mad at him and I told him he wasn't getting it.

I ended up giving it to my grandma and she decided to come with me (and two of my friends who already had their own tickets). Dad told me it was a spiteful move and that he couldn't afford a second one. Then he said his stepdaughter couldn't go on her own. I told him she's not welcome to come with us or tag along and he can figure it out. I even said fuck you to him because I was THAT mad.

My dad tried to get my mom to discipline me for it but she had my back. He said I'm being taught to be childish and spiteful and he said even saying his stepdaughter isn't welcome around me and my friends says how I'll punish others when my feelings get hurt.

AITA?"
1l5srr6,AITA for refusing to buy my son a car after he tormented a kid in his private school about his dad being the janitor,OneYard7870,AITAH,609,274,1749323767.0,"Never thought I would come to reddit for this shit but let me give some context, I own a construction company which is moderately successful in my side of the city so I'm decently well off so my son has had the privilege to be sent to a private school in a better part of the city, but the downside is that being surrounded by kids who's fathers own skyscrapers is giving him higher expectations, and in junior year he joined this obnoxious friend group which always wear designer everything and are really spoilt, one of these kids even drives an Aston Martin, couple years later in his senior years he's still in the same friend group with the same friends, (atleast they're loyal lol) and one day one of the kids called Brandon (not his real name for obvious reasons) kept bugging him on why he didn't have a ""proper"" car. (At this time he drove a 2016 Toyota RAV4 which ain't even that bad but compared to this kids Lexus it wasn't the flashiest.)

So two days later he asks to speak to me in private away from his mother and little brother, I went downstairs to the couch and he asked me if I could buy him a new car, I was expecting him to say like an audi or smth small, but no, this boy proceeded to show me a black bmw convertible, I asked him how much it was, he said $80K. 
$80K?? Boy you must be crazy cause I ain't buying you an 80 grand car when you're 17‚ò†Ô∏è.
Now I wouldn't have considered it anyway but the fact that his principal called me the day before about an incident with his classmate makes it a definite no no.
He had bullied this called Austin for a couple months because his dad worked as the school janitor and worked overtime to keep him in the school district, he made fun of Austin's clothes and other things which sent me into a fury when I heard about him, but we're talking about the same boy who apologied to furniture when he was 11, so I was a bit skeptical, so after he asked me, I asked him about the allegations with Austin, and this boy either inherited my braincells or he's just a full on idiot because he confirmed the whole thing, his exact words ""that charity case needs to know he's in the wrong crowd"".
I did not raise this kid to be a bully so I instantly grounded him and made him write an apology letter to Austin and made him send it. Oh you thought I was done boy, oh hell no, I scheduled a meeting with Austin's dad and the principal, Austin and my son were also there, i must have counted to 100 by the amount of times I apologized. But I knew my sweet boy wasn't the issue, it's that damn group of incompetent idiots he calls his friends, they are just pinning the blame on my boy, and he's so desperate for popularity he takes it, though I am pissed off at the whole situation, so my son isn't getting his phone or Xbox anytime soon, and definitely not a convertible. I'll post an update if there's anything new but probably not since it's a private matter and I just need to blow off some steam

Update: okay, thank you for the support and my final decision is that I will pull him out of private school and put him in a public school, he's also going to be volunteering at the local homeless shelter so he can learn what real empathy is, and hes going to be wearing normal clothes from now on, thank you all for making me realize how blind i've been all this time and I blamed his friends for all his trouble, but I forgot he was his own person and makes his own choices, and hes gonna be taking the bus to school from now on, I'll do a final update to see how it goes"
1l5ps8e,AITA for asking for a separate check?,plutofantasy,AITAH,877,354,1749316068.0,"So i go out to eat with my bfs family a lot for context. its him me, his 4 siblings, one of the siblings gf, the mom and their stepdad. Every time we go out the check is split 4 ways ( my bf and i together, his brother and his gf , the mom, and the stepdad) no matter how little or much i ordered which is dont think is right for anyone bc if i ordered 4 chicken tacos why am i paying for ur 3 beers, 2 apps and entree? so yesterday the waitress came and i asked for my bf and I to have a separate check they all looked at me crazy. so they said no together we split it i said no im paying for him and i, he told me no he wanted it together. so i said okay ill just pay for my food. i ordered an appetizer and a side cesar salad the tab was almost $400, why am i splitting it when my food was $25???? so they got mad, i explained i was not paying for stuff i didnt order and im not paying for her childrens meals. when i ordered 2 things. they all got mad and said well we all are splitting it i said that's fine yall can split it and ill pay for my meal. i left the restaurant by myself and didnt attend the things they had planned afterwards, because the situation was obviously not over. my bf goy mad at me and said i embarrassed at the restaurant and for not attending. im at a lost honestly. its the next day and everyone is still mad, AITA??"
1l5nf5s,AITA for calling my mom insane for expecting me to be mad at my dad's side of the family because they didn't treat my step and half siblings like me?,FlukeShooktth,AITAH,992,104,1749309974.0,"My dad died when I was really young. Him and my mom weren't together and he had primary custody of me. After he died mom got custody and tried to cut his family out of my life so they sued for grandparents rights and won. So my mom had custody and my paternal relatives had regular visitation.

I (17m) was 9 when my mom remarried. Her husband brought my three stepsiblings along and pretty much right away my mom and stepdad started having kids together.

Soon after my mom and her husband moved in together she asked my grandparents to be emergency contacts for my stepsiblings. Then it was expecting them to include my stepsiblings when it was their visitation time. Then calling and asking them to babysit. My grandparents said no and so did every member of dad's family who mom asked. Mom would lose her mind every time she saw them and she called them all sorts of shit for not including my stepsiblings.

Then my mom had another reason for a grudge. My parents weren't ever religious so I was never baptized but my dad got a bunch of photos of me in his old Christening outfit. My grandparents had it after dad died and mom wanted photos of my half siblings in it since she had photos of me in it. She decided it was reasonable for her to use it for my half siblings for that reason and she didn't like when she was told no.

I knew only some parts of it but it wasn't until a couple of weeks ago that mom told me all that and expected me to be mad at dad's side of my family on my step and half siblings behalf. She told me they deserved better and how could I not be mad at it and I told her it was insane to think I would be and that I'm old enough to get that her kids and stepkids are nothing to dad's family.

She told me it's not insane and I'm being abusive calling her that. She said it's gaslighting and trying to drive her crazy and she raised me better than that. AITA?"
1l5qypp,WIBTAH for cutting off my mother and golden child brother. Hopefully the final update.,Strict-Ad7079,AITAH,491,53,1749319081.0,"I thought my last post would be my final update, but things have escalated. I thought I could block my mother and my brother and it would be over but she has gone to new lengths.
Buckle up.
To recap, I made a post about wanting to cut off my toxic mother and golden child brother, after years of horrible mistreatment and abuse . 
I was in my home state visiting taking care of my sick dad when I made the first post. Please visit it for more info. 
It‚Äôs been a while since my last update. I blocked my mother and my brother. I thought that was the end and I hadn‚Äôt heard from them since blocking them until today. I returned to my fianc√©e and kids after my dad made a full recovery. I‚Äôve been back for almost three weeks now and everything has gone back to normal. Until this morning. 
While I was working today my phone blew up with messages and calls from distant family. Same story from everyone. 
It boiled down to the same thing ‚Äúcall your mom something happened.‚Äù After the seventh or eighth call I picked up it was my dad‚Äôs sister. I immediately thought my dad had fallen ill again or worse. But it turns out my mother had been telling everyone her father (my grandfather) had passed. Which I found funny. I had just gotten text from him two minutes ago. We talked daily and I told my aunt that. The silence was deafening and my aunt abruptly hung up. 
I called my grandfather and I‚Äôm crying laughing at this point this was so ridiculous. I explained the situation and there was a silencing the line for so long I thought he‚Äôd hung up. Then he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle this.‚Äù And hung up. 
The calls stopped immediately. I didn‚Äôt hear from my grandfather until I got off work. 
He explained that my mother hasn‚Äôt answered any calls but from what he gathered from our family my mother has been spiraling since I cut her off. She‚Äôs been digging for any information about where I live. Only my dad, brother and grandfather know. My dad and brother blocked her alongside me a couple months ago. She thought by faking my grandfather‚Äôs passing would drag me back home and into her narrative. This has only strengthened my resolve. I‚Äôve started getting calls from numbers I don‚Äôt recognize with numbers in my home state. I didn‚Äôt answer. But the voicemails come from my mom and brother calling me cruel, ignorant and the usual guilt trips of ruining the family. I‚Äôm considering a protective order. Would that be too harsh? My family is torn some say I should forgive others are saying I‚Äôm justified. So Reddit WIBTAH for wanting a restraining order?? "
1l5k4co,AITAH for telling neighbors kids can't come over anymore,Sure_Pineapple1935,AITAH,990,424,1749300744.0,"With summer approaching here, this has been weighing on me.  We (42f and 49m)  have next door neighbors who for the last few summers (and times during the school year) have been basically using me (teacher, summers off) as free childcare.  Their two kids show up at our house to play with my kids in the morning and most days stay all day until dinner.  The parents have never even asked if this is OK.  The kids just see us outside and come over or they come knock at my door.  The kids always play in my yard, so I feel responsible for supervising everyone.  These kids have joined in on family birthday parties, playdates with my kids' friends and cousins, and even holidays.  They just show up in our yard.  I have long thought their mom was not aware of how often the kids are at my house.  She works long hours outside the house and dad WFH.  SO, getting to me question:  I cannot take these kids showing up at my house uninvited to play everyday again this summer.  AITAH for texting the parents and telling them they need to ASK through a certain text message chain BEFORE sending their kids over to my house? OR to say please stop sending them uninvited to my house??  
I am questioning this because my kids really do like playing with theirs.  But, I feel that I never have any downtime or peace the last few summers and want to avoid that going forward. What do you think? "
1l5jdv0,AITAH for telling a woman her fianc√© cheated with me even though I didn‚Äôt know he was engaged?,Suspicious-Check25,AITAH,1051,289,1749298356.0,"This happened last month and it‚Äôs still haunting me. I (27F) met this guy, Caleb (32M), at a mutual friend‚Äôs birthday party. We talked all night, he was charming, funny, seemed super into me. We ended up hooking up that night and spent the entire weekend together. It honestly felt like the beginning of something real.

He told me he was single. No mention of a relationship, let alone a fianc√©e.

About two weeks later, I ran into him at a coffee shop. He looked like he‚Äôd seen a ghost. He was with a woman. She introduced herself as *his fianc√©e*, Leah. I didn‚Äôt say anything at the time, but when I got home I stalked her socials and saw their engagement photos. They‚Äôd been planning a wedding for over a year. I felt physically sick.

I sat with it for a few days, unsure if I should say anything. But then I thought about if the roles were reversed. I‚Äôd want to know. So I messaged her. I kept it respectful, I showed her screenshots, and told her everything. She didn‚Äôt respond at first, but three days later I got a message from her sister thanking me and letting me know the wedding was off.

Now I‚Äôm getting blown up by Caleb and two of his friends calling me a homewrecker. They‚Äôre saying I had no business getting involved, that I should‚Äôve just stayed quiet. But I honestly didn‚Äôt know he was engaged. And I don‚Äôt think protecting a liar is the right thing to do.

AITAH for telling her, even though I didn‚Äôt know at the time?"

            My wife said they are gross and it's a stupid TikTok trend. My wife said nobody wants a see a girl walk around with patches filled with pus. Our daughter started crying and she hid herself under the covers. Her mom was demanding that she takes off those patches but I walked my wife to our bedroom. 
         I told her that she was too harsh and my wife said I was undermining her. She said if I want to raise our daughter to be gross, then I should go ahead. Am I the asshole ?"

My partner 23 (F) asked for sex and we started and it was going well until about half way she stop moaning and stayed silent throughout the whole thing barely touching me aswell. I thought to my self this was one of her kinks (she's stated b4 she likes to pretend to not care during) we finish then she goes up to the bathroom to clean up. She then comes back still cold and I asked how it was for her and she said it was unenjoyable which I asked why she didn't stop it if it wasn't enjoyable. To which she said she wanted me to enjoy it. I got a bit upset at that saying it should be enjoyable for the both of us. To this she said, I have to make everything about me and that I just want to fight for no reason. I'm here to ask how I should proceed next I don't think im wrong about sex should be enjoyable for every party involved im I wrong? Please help."
1l5mi8w,AITA for not taking the offers to meet my half sister even if my deadbeat mom doesn't have to be involved?,AdvertisingSad6848,AITAH,385,106,1749307571.0,"For my whole life it's just been me (17f) and my dad (40m). He's been a single dad my whole life. Ever since my mom broke up with him in the hospital after I was born and walked out without me and refused to have anything to do with me. Dad got custody and he let mom's family see me. Over the years mom's family tried to organize times for her to meet me and she wasn't interested.

I met her once. I was 14 and it was a shitty experience. She got into a fight with her parents over her lack of involvement with me and my mom fought back by saying she had been willing to get back with dad before but he refused to give me up. Which started a whole new fight about why not ask to be a family again and be a mom instead of wanting just my dad. I got home that night and dad had to stay up with me because man did it hurt to realize she wanted dad for years and was bitter he didn't want her without me. But she wanted nothing to do with me.

Six months ago my mom had another baby, a girl. So I now have a half sister. Although I don't claim her or tell others I have one. I still say I'm an only child. My mom's family wanted me to come and meet her but I refused and after three or four small fights over it they offered to have the baby over so I could meet and interact with her without my mom there. I told them they didn't need to because I didn't want to meet her. I said it's better off that she never meets me because I won't ever see her as my sister, because we don't share parents. They were like maybe not parents but blood and I asked them why that mattered. They wanted one good reason and I told them my life did not change at all knowing another person came from the same eggs and womb as me.

My mom's pregnant again so now the pressure is being piled on more for me to meet my half sister so I'll meet the next baby my mom gives birth to and so I'll want a relationship with any kids she has now. My answer has stayed the same and this includes the offers for me to meet the baby without mom being there. They can do that because they babysit and stuff.

AITA?"
1l5bp4f,AITAH for saying I'll report my credit card stolen and cut my family medical insurance if she insisted on adding the neighbors?,xCirce_,AITAH,2229,116,1749268335.0,"My first language isn't English so be nice. Last month I put my credit card information so my family (I (25F), my mom (49F), my dad (52M) and my little brother (10M).) could get a medical insurance. My parents offered to pay it back at the end of the month or whatever they can since they don't have formal jobs. I was perfectly okay with that, the first month when perfectly fine. The second month my mom said she would use the benefit of being able to add two people more without paying more. The first person was one uncle who lost his job and have some serious medical issues. That was fine.
The second person was the neighbors baby. Not related at us. Not even good neighbors.
The thing is that you still had to pay for stuff when you make an appointment, you can pay in the moment or on the next month bill, and I know this people, the won't pay anything they owe.
I started arguing with my mom because why are she offering this stuff to other people and her answer (supported by my dad) is that since I didn't have them a grandchild, they wanted to be involved on a baby life so they offered that to the neighbors. 
So I told my mom that it doesn't matter if she payed back or whatever, if I found a single appointment from them on the bill I'll report the credit card stolen and she would have to find a way to pay it. 
We aren't in a good position economically to add a baby that isn't us to the equation because the want to play grandma and grandpa.
More info: where we live we had public and free medical attention. We got the insurance just in case because they called and offered. "
1l5774p,Am I wrong for telling him I don‚Äôt want to get married anymore?,Changamire01,AITAH,4821,668,1749254007.0,So my boyfriend and I were supposed to get married this December. Let‚Äôs call him M. M and I have been together for 2 years and planned to get married this coming December. Last week M called me and said him and his parents sat down and decided that him getting married this year would be impractical and he should get married next year instead. He told me that this is what his family has decided and I should deal with it. I explained to him that him deciding this with his parents really hurt my feelings and M said he was sorry but he couldn‚Äôt afford it anymore and he had to prioritize other things and honor his parents wishes. Two days later he texts me and says he wants us to go back to our original date but I told him no. That I don‚Äôt want to get married to him anymore because he has shown me how little he values my opinion and I don‚Äôt want a man who changes plans like he changes clothes. He got mad and said that he was giving me what I wanted so why was I being difficult and I asked him I thought you said you didn‚Äôt have money for that anymore and M claims he wants to thug it out. So AITA for not wanting to get married anymore 
1l5u17f,AITA for calling the cops on my mentally ill neighbour?,Worried_Strawberry,AITAH,99,113,1749327176.0,"I F25 and my boyfriend M27 are living in our apartment complex since 2022. We have a next door neighbour that is mentally ill, often talk to himself, punching walls, screaming to himself and overalls being an odd neighbour. Recently, he‚Äôs been screaming inside his apartment and the whole floor could hear him punching onto something. At 2am, he and his girlfriend are either screaming at each other or punching the wall. I was fed up with the screaming so I called the cops this afternoon for the noise.

Now here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm an asshole. They have a toddler inside and I saw child protective services taking the kid away. The neighbours thinkI went too far but I didn‚Äôt know there was a kid in there. "
1l5fw0m,AITA for keeping my dad as a civil acquaintance instead of family because he married a woman who talked shit about my mom?,ChoiceMacaroon3790,AITAH,874,83,1749284572.0,"My parents divorced when I (33m) was 9 and my sister was 7. After a couple of years my dad started dating ""Susan"" and she talked shit about my mom despite not meeting her until her and dad got engaged. My sister and I told our dad we didn't like or approve of Susan and he told us he loved her and we should give her a chance because she was a great person.

Susan continued to talk shit about my mom and we called her out on it regularly. When she and my dad had some kids together she told us it was wrong to correct the mother of our siblings and we were being unfair to the kids. Dad told us we should ignore her when she talks about mom and look at her as a person in her own right and judge her that way.

I know I didn't give details of Susan talking shit about mom so I'll explain a few. She'd ask what kind of mom let her son wear pink. She called my mom Looney Tunes for having a mental illness. She'd call mom lazy because we got school lunches instead of homemade ones despite dad also paying for us to get school lunches and not making them. She repeatedly said my mom had an annoying voice and it made her want to attack mom. All of this before she met or spoke to my mom. And that's not all of it even before they met.

As soon as I turned 17 I stopped going to dad's house and only answered the phone when I felt like it. As an adult I have maintained a civil but distant relationship with my dad. He's not someone I treat like family and I have nothing to do with his wife or their kids. That isn't something I want to change and I have told dad that civil acquaintances is the best he'll ever get from me. My sister has communicated something very similar to him.

Dad was hurt he was invited to neither of our weddings and that we have not included him in the families we're both building now. He saw my oldest two kids once and that was brief. Other than that time, there hasn't been a time where we were in the same room since I turned 17.

He has asked why we can't all get along and be a family again and I told him he chose to marry the woman who talked shit about my mom. I said I was extremely disappointed in him as a dad after that. And that I want better for my kids. And I would never in a million years let his wife's presence ruin moments for my family. I also told him I would never ever want her around my kids. I told him that I held a very different opinion of his wife than he did and I did not find her good company or worthy of being in my children's lives.

He told me it's cruel to treat him like a random person when he's my dad and I told him he knew the deal. Then I suggested we just end all contact and he said no, he doesn't want to lose me, he wants to bring me back into the family. I told him it would never happen and he needs to figure out what he wants. He called me stubborn and said I should give it a chance because I don't even know his other kids which is wrong. I really don't care. I never felt anything for my half siblings and I don't have a wish to know them.

AITA for keeping my relationship with dad the way it has been for the last 15 years?"
1l5u2gt,AITA for refusing to engage with my sister's pettiness where she's trying to use a baby name she and the rest of our family agreed to save for me to use?,New-Penalty-2437,AITAH,90,75,1749327272.0,"My younger sister (26f) has 3 boys and she's expecting her first girl. I (32m) don't have kids yet but my wife and I just started trying. Our maternal grandmother died when I was 5 and before the rest of my siblings were born. She lived with my parents and me and I adored her. I was the only grandchild who remembers her. So several years ago my siblings and cousins agreed that the name should be saved for me, to use if I had a daughter. They told me about it and they told the rest of our family. My sister was supposedly in agreement at the time.

But after becoming a mom the first time my sister turned into an immature and petty brat. She turns the weirdest stuff into a competition. Like who can have the most kids. Or who gets the most stuff for their baby. Or who can get the most compliments on their cooking. She'd brag to me that she was the first of mom and dad's kids to make them grandparents and she'd ask me if I was going to be a grandpa before I had any kids. She'd whine at me and our other siblings if we met up when she couldn't make it. She expected us to wait until she could come and even expected us to plan our birthdays around her. Then she wanted us to add her name to a gift for mom and dad without her contributing anything. Not the planning, the paying or the getting of the gift.

It's exhausting and her lifelong friends and other family members have complained about it too.

Now she's decided she's going to use our maternal grandma's name for her daughter. She told me in front of our parents, siblings, her partner and my wife. She was smirking and said that we clearly weren't having kids (even though she knows we started trying) she doesn't feel like the name should be saved for me and she deserves it and her baby deserves it as the first granddaughter. The rest of our family protested the decision but I just told her she was entitled to name her child what she likes and I changed the subject. It drove her crazy and she told me I was trying to make her look bad by giving in just like that. My wife asked her how that would make her look bad and wouldn't fighting me over it be worse. The rest of our family said the name should be saved for the only grandchild who remembered her and how it was agreed they would save it for me. The rest of my siblings were like you shouldn't let her get away with this pettiness. I feel that not engaging is better.

Does it upset me a little? Sure. Could I use the name anyway? Yeah, but my wife and I agree it would be better not to. We might not even have a daughter. And if we do we'll figure it out but we don't want my sister taking it out on our hypothetical future daughter. My wife said she might go for a different name because I don't fight her on it and maybe. It's possible. Grandma's name is VERY different to names she typically likes. Either way just let her use it if she wants is my stance.

A stance my family thinks I'm crazy for and they've told me I'm letting her walk all over me. AITA?"
1l5qae3,AITAH for revealing my ex boyfriend cheated in the group chat?,LickingPalletes,AITAH,139,66,1749317377.0,"I (22F) got cheated on by my ex boyfriend (24M) of two years.

He wasn't interested in my hobbies anymore. Beekeeping, Gardening and Hiking. His hobbies are more nerdy like Video Games and movies. He did seem interested when we first started dating and wanted to learn more about mine. We clicked really well for a while.

I found out he was cheating because I went through his instagram  mutuals and saw a girl I never seen before. She looked like the nerdy type in the picture. Glasses, half red dyed hair and a star wars T shirt. She also had an onlyfans link in her bio.  I asked him about it and he seemed nervous but denied it. I found out he was most definitely cheating when I went through his text messages while he was in the shower.

That was over a month ago now. I broke up with him. I didn't tell anyone outside of my family until a couple days ago. I revealed that my bf cheated on me and we are no longer together and one of my friends bashed me for breaking up with him. Someone else there said I should of just never of said anything. They wouldn't explain themselves when I asked why they were being rude to me. I got kicked out of the group chat and they all blocked me.

At first, he's a great success in the job, but over the years, problems with his loose-cannon enforcer Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), his ex-hustler wife Ginger (Sharon Stone), her con-artist ex Lester Diamond (James Woods) and a handful of corrupt politicians put Sam in ever-increasing danger.

Of course, like many, I saw them back in high school‚Äîbut watching them now, with fresh eyes and a bit more life behind me, left me in absolute awe.

Quentin Tarantino truly crafted something unreal with these films. The stylistic range, the pacing, the character arcs, the music, the cinematography‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all so intentional, so bold, and so damn cool. It reminded me of just how thrilling movies can be when every frame feels like it was made with love and madness.

I‚Äôve been craving that ‚Äúholy sh*t, THIS is cinema‚Äù feeling for a while now, and Kill Bill delivered it in spades. It‚Äôs a reminder of why we fall in love with film in the first place.

Just so many WTF moments in there I can't even recount them all. And it was like watching two totally different movies smashed together. 

I saw it recommended in a thread here recently. Couldn't remember why though. I just gave it a quick search and saw that it was George Clooney, Harvey Kitel, Selma Hyek and that Tarantino had something to do with it. Sounded like the makings of a good flick.

I generally hate spoilers, so I usually don't read much about movies outside of the basic premise before I watch them. The last movie that blindsided me this bad was when I watched Bone Tomahawk.

A well paced, good script, well acted movie about less known stories who arent as flashy and glamour.

There are so many aspect of baseball which i didnt get ofcourse but I dont even think this movie needs a person to know so much about baseball.

Point is this movie subverts almost every sports movie clich√©. I am a big football fan and I follows different clubs, league games, manegerial stuff, transfers nd all And i can resonate every thing about movie. There‚Äôs no big championship scene, no locker room speech, no slow-mo victory montage. Instead, it‚Äôs about spreadsheets, stats, undervalued players and background story of how much pressure they go through.

Brad pitt was just excellent and he should have won oscar for this one rather than OUATIH. Its simply one of the best nuanced performance i have ever seen. Brings so much depth to the character without going offbeat for once yet hit every stress conflict scenes perfectly. Probably my fav performance of him

Emotional as well last scene, that daughter tape made me smile and sad at same time.

If there is any person who havent seen this movie, give it a chance its something very rare and fresh air. 10/10 already one of my all time fav movies list."

One of my favorite LOTR scenes is all about this; the scene in ""Return of the King"" after the four hobbits have returned to the Shire and are sitting at the Green Dragon pub surrounded by their fellow hobbits and awkwardly feeling out of place. It's a moment very akin to soldiers coming back from war and one that J.R.R. Tolkien, himself a WWI veteran, would approve of; the foursome have been through so much that they can never fit in amongst their fellow hobbits again (and indeed, not one of them ends up spending their final days in the Shire). It's not just ""how can we go back to our mundane old lives after everything we've been through"", it's also, ""wow, we've been outside the cave, we can never relate to these people again."" It's one of the quietest moments of the trilogy and yet very effective in how much experiences can make your old life unobtainable again."

So I tried to give Witcher 3 a shot and couldn't get past the first mission. My first attempt was right after I'd played Bloodborne which tbf was a tough game to follow. So I dropped it and over the course of the next 10 years, picked it up at various stages of life with no luck. I just couldn't get into it. I think at best, I made it halfway through Act I. 

Fast forward to 2025, I basically forced myself to play it because on paper it was everything I loved about games and I vowed to finish it no matter what. And it just clicked! And what more? I'm kinda addicted? I got my platinum and I am obsessed with Gwent. It's such a stunning game and the music omg. Going to finish the DLC too but just wanted to share my joy here because...wtf?

1l51js5,Ifixit's teardown of switch 2 reveals that the sticks seem to be just as susceptible to drifting as switch 1 was. Overall repairability of the whole device is difficult,Iggy_Slayer,gaming,3638,398,1749239032.0,"I'll post the joycon part but the rest of the article has some interesting info like the game card reader not being modular anymore and nintendo putting tamper proof stickers in it.

>The Joy-Con opening process seems straightforward from the outside, with two of Nintendo's signature tri-point screws. But that only gets us so far. A glued-on plastic rib hides more screws, including another tri-point. That's not intuitive, and it turns what should be a basic repair into a frustrating guessing game. With this reliance on adhesive, we wonder how well it'll go back together. Only time will tell.  
  
Once inside, the battery is easy to disconnect but hard to remove, secured with more adhesive. The tray under the battery also takes some coaxing. We were able to get the joystick out by flipping the controller over, wrenching the thumbgrip off from the other side, then unclipping the housing. We can't promise this won't damage the joystick. We'll keep testing and hope to come up with a better procedure by the time we publish our official repair guides.  
  
And after all that? Sure looks like the same old potentiometer tech. There's no sign of Hall effect or TMR sensors. Instead, we're getting more of the same.  
  
If you've dealt with joystick drift on the original Switch, Lite, or OLED, you know what's coming. And unless Nintendo is using some miracle new material on those resistive tracks, or the change in size magically solves it, the best fix is going to come from third-party replacements like GuliKit again. And, not to brag, but those sticks paired with some iFixit guides? A match made in heaven."

[Patch 25.10](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/patch-25-10-notes/) - Fearless Draft

1l5r37p,"Fearless draft is one of the best things that has happened to pro play and, looking back, it is weird that it wasn't implemented sooner",Magn9257,leagueoflegends,908,207,1749319391.0,"It makes games so much more fun and entertaining when you don't have to look at the same 10 champions over and over again, and it rewards players who are able to adapt.

It also arguably enables some champions to escape pro play jail, which is nice. I would also think that, as an outside viewer, you would be more inclined to play the game when you can see the vast amount of different characters that the game has to offer.

  
Big kudos to whoever came up with that idea lol"

Seeding will be on the line as they will face G2 Esports tomorrow.

Movistar KOI:

- are the 4th team to have qualified for the 2025 Mid Season Invitational alongside G2 Esports, CTBC Flying Oyster and GAM Esports.

1l5oymw,Skin splash arts looking wayy to similar and having insane same-face syndrome. (Especially newer ones),netacowo,leagueoflegends,177,38,1749313965.0,"I'm mostly talking about splash arts, but some of these could extend to in game visual clarity too (mainly thinking of crystal rose janna and zyra) 

I understand there are 170 champs, and some of these are more of a reach than others, but if riot put more effort into making FUN splash arts that show personality instead of ""x character with x theme (hot)"" they could avoid this. 

And i understand some of these are the same skinline but especially then you'd think that they'd put more effort to diffrenciate between champs???

Also the fact that on most skins nowadays (esp with female champs) you could NEVER tell who it is judging by the face. (as example i included spirit blossom evelynn)

lmk if you have other examples!!!!!

1l5kpxs,Congratulations to the 3rd team that has qualified for MSI 2025!,ahritina,leagueoflegends,248,25,1749302511.0,"GAM Esports will be the second team representing the LCP at the 2025 Mid Season Invitational, joining CTBC Flying Oyster after beating TALON with Sion and Tristana getting back to back Elder Drakes.

Seeding will be on the line as they will face CTBC Flying Oyster tomorrow.

GAM Esports:

- are the 3rd team to have qualified for the 2025 Mid Season Invitational alongside G2 Esports and CTBC Flying Oyster.

- are the 4th team to have qualified for the EWC 2025 alongside T1, G2 Esports and CTBC Flying Oyster."

I remember reading they don't want to buff her as players find her frustrating to play against. 

Soooo...their plan is to just not do anything until they have time to midscope her? Like that's the plan? "

Pretty much every other auto-based skirmisher/duelist like him rush it, such as:

but then somehow it just won't work on him, anyone knows the reason why?

1l5ttea,I still love NA league of legends,crm1234567891,leagueoflegends,40,10,1749326588.0,"I am still excited about the LTA. My favorite team in Flyquest is finally good in LTA (been watching since 2019), and it feels good to see them steamroll the competition. I am not being paid by the LTA to say that this year has been a rlly exciting one in terms of teams. There are so many storylines to be explored. People said the LTA had none, so let me spill some out.

1. Disguised

* Immortals 2.0, it was fun to see them manage to scrape a win against TL, and there is ofc the hype that is relegation now, so to me, Disguised is an exciting team through that perspective. We can finally see a team fight their way to stay in the LTA.

1. Dignitas

* I'm probably the only Tomo fan in the world, I like seeing him play and all that. I like Dignitas because they seem to be the one low tier team that actually tries to roster build, and so each year it always seems cool to see which way they are going.

1. LYON

* Even though they are out of the picture, I find LYON exciting because they had that little arc where they were stomping the low tier teams, and it was fun to see if they were top 4 contenders. They are such a mystery to me in terms of strength, so I find it really fun to see what they will be like during the summer.

1. 100 Thieves

* Though this year is the farewell year, and there are signs of decline for sure. I cannot help but admire this team. Sniper, River, Quid, all of these guys are names that excites me. The reason why I look forward to this team is because I want to see where their farewell tour ends.

1. Shopify

* If I am a neutral in the LTA scene, I would root tf out of this team. They are such an exciting new face. I hate to say it to people who don't like him, but I love Fudge. I also love contractz and palafox too. I remember FLY palafox, those were dark times. Anyways, this is a team that is hot, so I would love love love to see them knocking on the door of the top 4.

1. Team Liquid

* In case you couldn't tell by now, I am a contrarian to players reddit hates. I love impact. I love apa. I love umti. I LOVE THIS TL. People understandably don't like this iteration because of their international performances, and APA's trash talk does get cringe, but these players are so loveable. They are another mystery team, where I am so so curious where they'll end up by the end of this year.

1. Cloud 9

* If there is one team in the LTA that I don't have a favorable attitude towards, it's C9, but again, I love their roster so so much. Blaber is the one player that got me into LCS lowkey, and I love seeing him perform. This C9 is so hype because they are rising to the top, and beat a duopoly that the LTA had. I also love hatewatching them. But, if I were a C9 fan, I would absolutely look forward to see what this potential title winning year has for them.

1. FlyQuest

* If there was a god, they hate me, because why is it when my favorite team has the LTA by its throat, no one cares for the league anymore. I love this team. I love Bwipo's counterpicks. I love how cool inspired looks, his poses looking nonchalant on the posters. I love Quad, his personality seems adorable. Massu is another NA talent that ppl have to have to keep their eyes on. Busio is also amazing to watch this year, and like, it does feel weird when EU claims Busio when he is successful, but that's irrelevant."
1l5n8kr,Why is YOUR main champion(s) the hardest character in League?,A_Trickster,leagueoflegends,95,206,1749309501.0,"Deep down, you probably know that your main champion is very likely not the hardest champion to pilot, it might not even be hard to play in the first place. I want you to make your case as to why your champion is the hardest (or one of) to play, no matter how ridiculous or unrealistic you make it sound. I'll start.

Sivir: I consider Sivir a very difficult champion to play. Her kit might initially seem simple enough, but applying it in game is much much harder. Her Q is a harder-than-usual skillshot to land since it's quite slow. She doesn't have a strong self-buff ultimate. Her main weakness is that her kit is heavily focused on teamfight AoE damage which is only really effective against very specific team comps and sucks against pretty much everything else.

She has the lowest AA range over any marksman, which automatically makes her harder to play in any situation (more in threat range, also gets damaged first before dishing damage out). She also doesn't have any serious AA steroid (Jinx, Ashe) to assist her in any 1v1 and doesn't have anything to provide value in a 1v1 (like a strong rotation of spells like Lucian). She has relocation spell to assist her (only MS buffs as mobility) which requires even more precise position by her, her spellshield is good but still needs timing and only blocks one spell (unlike Fiora W, Pantheon E etc) and her R is just a teamwide buff without any real benefit on her, aside from its passive part. 

She only really shines in wavepushing and getting prio out of it and offering strong DPS if she is able to hit something in the frontline that is relatively safe for her to do (something like a Sion) allowing for her ricochets to melt the rest of the team from ""range"". Otherwise, picking ANY OTHER ADC is just fundamentally better in at least one way.

Since they‚Äôre e-waste and my managers aren‚Äôt too technically inclined they sold us parts for the raw material value which was only $10. 

I bought a 3080 TI that looked in perfect condition but it didn‚Äôt post, so I tried this slightly beat up 3090 - aside from one broken fan, and slightly warped shroud it booted first try and has been my main GPU for 2 years now :)  it still had the plastic peels on it.

My coworker also got a 3070 TI, but it had a line in the display. He ended up RMA‚Äôing it and had a fully functioning 3070 TI for $30. 

Unfortunately the upper management caught on and stopped selling us cheap parts, but I got some good deals while I was there.

Everyone is too focused on ai as a hype cycle, in terms of currently limited use case, cap ex, etc. What you are not seeing and is the real reason root reason is the huge growth in productivity which it's unlocking or about to unlock.

The market doesn't really give a fuck about Trump, it cares about future cash flows. If you stay on top of the current capabilities of ai, and where it's heading you know that labour is about to get devalued enormously and capitol is everything.

When the need for skill labour rapidly reduces, head counts shrink, business outputs improve and profitability spikes across the board, being an owner of capital is key.

We receive income from the trust, which earns money from several other things as well; it‚Äôs all bundled together. Figuring out what portion of my rental income comes from the ICE client is not possible, as the family member who manages it declines to go to the trouble, which I understand is considerable.

I feel pretty horrible about getting money from an immigration prison, but I‚Äôm the only beneficiary of the trust who cares. I could resign from the trust, but my husband of 50 years would get my share ‚Äî and anyway, our funds are completely mingled.

I‚Äôm not sure you can make me feel any better about this, but I‚Äôm curious about the ethics of receiving money from an entity you consider kind of evil. I went to a lot of Catholic schools, including a Jesuit university. I don‚Äôt know all the finer points, but it feels unethical. My husband and his family think this is ridiculous. What is your opinion? Is there a correct action? ‚Äî Name Withheld

From the Ethicist:

It‚Äôs understandable that you‚Äôre troubled. Court rulings, investigative reporting and firsthand accounts have shown that ICE has acted in ways that not only harm noncitizens but also erode the rights of citizens.

Even so, the existence of an immigration-enforcement agency isn‚Äôt inherently the problem. Most people accept that states have a right to control their borders and that there‚Äôs a legitimate role for authorities charged with enforcing immigration policy, especially when it comes to those who have committed serious crimes. ICE also investigates trafficking, smuggling and other transnational offenses that clearly require federal oversight.

The core issue is less the agency‚Äôs mandate than its methods. Well-documented abuses ‚Äî denials of due process, inhumane conditions and politically motivated enforcement ‚Äî have undermined public trust and raised serious ethical concerns. The worry is not whether immigration law should be enforced but how, and at what human cost.

The holding facilities ICE uses are part of this system: They house people awaiting deportation, court appearances or further investigation. What‚Äôs in dispute isn‚Äôt the need for such spaces; it‚Äôs the treatment of detainees within those spaces. Many facilities have drawn criticism for degrading or dangerous conditions. Still, as a beneficiary of a trust that rents a property to ICE, your leverage is minuscule. You can‚Äôt unilaterally break the lease. Even if you could, ICE would simply relocate its facility. And while moral complicity is a serious concern, receiving income from a legal tenant, however problematic, isn‚Äôt generally considered an ethical transgression on its own.

We‚Äôre all entangled in systems we don‚Äôt control. As citizens, we‚Äôre already implicated in the actions of government agencies that act in our name and that we help fund. If those actions are shameful, they cast a shadow on all of us. But that shared entanglement also opens the door to shared responsibility ‚Äî and response.

You mentioned your Jesuit university. You‚Äôll probably remember, then, the emphasis placed on ‚Äúdiscernment‚Äù ‚Äî not just abstract moral reasoning but the habit of examining one‚Äôs own position in the world, with clarity and courage, and then acting on that understanding. So here‚Äôs one constructive path: If this money feels tainted, redirect it. Use it to support organizations that advocate for the rights you believe ICE has violated ‚Äî groups like the A.C.L.U., the American Immigration Council or local legal-aid nonprofits that provide support for detainees. Back candidates pushing for humane immigration reform. It‚Äôs a way to turn your sense of passive complicity into a measure of active redress. You may not be able to change the trust‚Äôs lease, but you can choose what your share of the proceeds stands for."

1l5ke7o,What is going on with Trump's admin returning Abrego Garcia to the US after being adamant that they wpuld not do it?,EffortCommon2236,OutOfTheLoop,1797,323,1749301560.0,"[Abrego Garcia has been returned to the US to face criminal charges](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/politics/kilmar-abrego-garcia). I am glad he has been taken out of a foreign prison where he had been sent ilegally.

What I am wondering is why the US did it, since for the last three months the vice president JD Vance,  the adviser Stephen Miller and specially the attorney general Pam Bondi were adamant that Garcia had not been sent to a prison in another country by mistake, and that he would never be allowed back. They had gone as far as to say that a Supreme Court ruling that the US should ""facilitate"" his return meant that the admin did not really have to actually return him, claiming that as a victory."

4. He is currently busy invading Mary Geoise.

Since this SATA was connected to the motherboard, they didn't test it or the drive in isolation.  Thankfully, after speaking with customer support, they agreed to replace the hard drive itself; however, since ""they don't offer in-house data recovery,"" I would still need to pay $3500 out of pocket to have that done through them if I chose to.

From what I can tell the motherboard died, so I'll be replacing the CPU, motherboard, PSU, RAM and CPU Cooler. As for the GPU, I'll stick with my 1080 for now and upgrade later. I will use my existing peripherals.

I chose the 9600x as it seems to be the best budget gaming CPU at the moment and it's also AM5 which gives me a good upgrade pathway. I don't really know anything about motherboards but I've heard ASRock seems to be the best brand right now and I want the ability to OC and this board seems to support that. I went for an 850W PSU to support future high end GPUs.

I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing but any help is much appreciated!

1l5jlaj,Final AM4 upgrade or let it die,confusedmilenial,buildapc,79,69,1749299053.0,"Hey guys!!

Basically, built a PC (with this subs help, ty so much!) on AM4. Current important specs:

3700x CPU
5700XT GPU
32GB 3600MHz RAM
750W PSU

Now the question, is a final upgrade on AM4 worth it or should i just run it till something shits the bed and then switch socket. Switching socket would mean new RAM and new motherboard at least (probably also a new PSU just in case). Staying with AM4 would likely be upgrade to 5700x3d or 5800x3d (if I can find it) and to the 9700XT (or maybe 9600XT havent really looked too hard at my GPU options), keeping everything else the same.

Is that upgrade path worth it? Is there a better option if I wanted to stay with AM4? Is it worth just forgoing AM4 and waiting for greener pastures?

Would love your guys' opinion. Have a lovely day :)"
1l5anen,Learning experience: can‚Äôt believe how much a $18 CPU cooler improved my build.,Pookie2018,buildapc,406,85,1749264815.0,"When I built my PC two years ago, I simply used the Wraith CPU cooler included with my Ryzen 5600X thinking it must be adequate if it came with the chip. I put 4 case fans in my build, two intake and two exhaust, assuming it was more than enough. The computer always ran hot, but I figured that was normal until I was playing Oblivion Remastered on ultra and the CPU temp ran over 90C. I saw a Thermalright Assasin X120 on sale on Amazon for $18 and figured why not.

After a 10 minute installation I fired up Oblivion again and saw my CPU temps drop from >90C to ~59C. The rest of my case fans are all running so quietly now because they are not trying to compensate for the crappy Wraith cooler.

1l5pjms,Keep 5080 FE at MSRP or return? Is it dumb to pair it with a 5600x?,ethereumkid,buildapc,14,40,1749315485.0,"Managed to score a 5080 FE for MSRP a couple of days ago. 

Originally, I was waiting for a 9070XT or 5070Ti at MSRP but lucked out with the 5080 FE. 

My current rig is the following:

* AMD 5600x + ASUS B450i (PCI-e 3.0 X16)
* 32 GB RAM 3200 CL14
* 3070Ti FE
* Corsair SF600 Gold
* Asus 4K 144hz

With bottlenecking in mind, could my current rig hold me over till AM6 if I crank the visuals up at 4K? I mostly play single player games. 

I was looking at the 5700X3D / 5800X3D but these have shot up in price. It doesn't really make any sense to overpay to extend the AM4 system."

Due to my specific wattage needs, i've been torn between a grabbing a 5090 laptop or building a decent PC that wont exceed 350 watts on full load. 

I currently live on an apartment unit where my AC will be running 18-20hours a day (1150 watts) . I've been told that my Apartment unit has a 1500-1800w breaker limit so i don't want to overload that , if im to factor in microwave , external monitors , oven and other life essentials like air purifier.

Anyhow, im in need of a 350 watt build with 96-128gb ram for video editing purposes and some minor gaming on the side (mostly indie games/nba2k and gta 5 online)

What would be your builds ""average"" wattage for productivity? and what would be your wattage during gaming? im particularly looking for an energy efficient card since i already know what i want for the rest of my build. Any input is appreciated!"

My real issue is that I haven‚Äôt done this at all before, my friend built it for me and I‚Äôm not a computer hardware person. I‚Äôve never built or taken apart a pc or anything tech related really.

1l5981w,I rendered the End rings with math,Daxaroodles,Minecraft,3194,79,1749260229.0,"I was inspired by [garocromwell's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/yp3ogi/the_ends_outer_rings_art_based_on_mc159283_and/?chainedPosts=t3_n1hece) to try and make mathematically accurate End rings. Each pixel is 4,000 blocks wide, which in total makes this 10,240,000 blocks wide.

I used an online seed viewing tool to measure the sizes of the first 10 rings (+ ring #15), then I used Desmos' graphing calculator to attempt to make a line of best fit. I'm probably off by 100-1,000 blocks here and there, but I don't think it really matters since, y'know, each pixel is 4,000 blocks wide. Here's the calculations I came up with:

**Ring thickness:** y = 99835 / ((x / 7.243223171) + 1)

**Void thickness (before each ring):** y = (153560 / ((x / 4.1) + 0.55)) / 2 + 14730

The first ring is 0, not 1, so be careful when using these lol. To calculate how wide each ring actually is, I just summed the thickness of all prior rings/void gaps.

I was originally going to draw this with an actual seed finder, but then I realised it was too difficult so I used Gamemaker instead. The image was rendered as orthographic rather than perspective, and although I could probably fix that later to make it look more 3D, I'm pretty contempt with how it is now. And yes, I did render the 1,000 block gap between the main island and outer islands."

14gjb8x,What happened to /r/mildlyinteresting?,RedSquaree,mildlyinteresting,12701,2127,1687478599.0,"Dear mildlyinterested reader,

We want to extend our heartfelt gratitude for your patience and unwavering support during the recent turbulence in our community. Our subreddit is a labour of love, and we've weathered this storm together.

Recent events have been confusing for all of us, from the vote, sudden removal of moderators, to conflicting messages from Reddit. As your mod team, we feel it's essential to clarify the situation.

On June 19, [the poll results favoured partially reopening with changes](https://redd.it/14dmkw1). However, before implementing these changes, Reddit took sweeping actions, removing all 27 moderator accounts without warning. This left us baffled and concerned.

Here's a brief timeline of the events:

1. On June 19, the poll results favoured partially reopening with changes. We announced the vote results and planned changes to the sub, including marking it as NSFW due to the common posts of phallic objects (no explicit content allowed). [CLICK HERE TO VIEW THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED AND LOCKED FOR POSTERITY](https://redd.it/14eox9x).

2. A tug-of-war between the u/ModeratorCodeOfConduct account and the remaining moderators ensued, with the post repeatedly being removed and reinstated. Each mod involved was immediately locked out of Reddit. Subreddit settings were also unilaterally changed by the admin account.

3. Eventually, all moderators were removed and suspended for 7 days, with the vote results deleted and the community set to ‚Äúarchived.‚Äù 

4. A lot of public outrage ensued, with details posted on r/ModCoord about what happened. At that point, no other subreddit had been targeted yet, leaving the situation uniquely unclear.

5. Admin cited actions as an ""error"" and promised to work with us to solve the situation. For /r/mildlyinteresting posterity, this will henceforth be referred to as The Mistake‚Ñ¢.

6. All our accounts were unsuspended and reinstated, but only with very limited permissions (modmail access only). For what it's worth, 'time moderated' for every moderator was reset (e.g. /u/RedSquaree moderated since 11 years ago, reset: currently showing moderated since ""1 day ago"").

7. The awaited discussion never happened. Instead, the admins presented us with an ultimatum: reopen the subreddit and do not mark it as NSFW, or face potential removal again. The inconsistent and arbitrary application of Reddit's policies reveals a possible conflict of interest in maximizing ad revenue at the risk of user safety and community integrity.

8. Finally, our moderation permissions were restored after we ""promised"" to comply with their conditions, but we kept the subreddit restricted while we ponder our next steps..

Problems remain unresolved, and Reddit's approach to policies and communication have been troubling. We believe open communication and partnership between Reddit and its moderators are crucial for the platform's success.

As a team, we remain dedicated to protesting Reddit's careless policy changes. Removing ourselves or vandalizing the subreddit won‚Äôt achieve our goals, but rather hinder our community. We're here to ensure r/mildlyinteresting isn't left unattended.

We call for the establishment of clear, structured, and reliable communication channels between Reddit admins and moderation teams. Teams should be informed and consulted on decisions affecting their communities to maintain trust and integrity on the platform. We shared this request with the Admin who promised to work with us, so far they have ignored it. 

Us mods are still deciding how exactly to reopen, not that we have been given much choice.

Sincerely,

The r/mildlyinteresting mods"

People are probably tired of hearing about it, but once again Mike Evans has reached 1,000 yards in a season. That ties him with The GOAT Jerry Rice for most consecutive 1K yard seasons (11), and extends his own record of starting a career with 1K yards.

That's rare air.

This season wasn't exactly the smoothest for big Mike, starting his fewest number of games (14) since 2019 where he only started 13. Despite that, he still put up double-digit TDs for the 7th time in his career. He also set a career high in catch percentage hauling in 74 receptions on only 110 targets making the most of what he was given.

He eclipsed some pretty notable milestones this year to extend his legacy. He surpassed 100 TDs and 12,000 yards. Next season he should be able to easily move into the top 8 in receiving TDs and top 20 in yards building on to his HoF career.

  
Mike Evans defied my expectations somewhat, and it still shows how great he is when at the bye week he was coming off probably the biggest injury stretch he's had in his career. Coming into week 12 after the Bucs' bye he had only 335 yards, which meant over the next 7 games he needed a whopping 665 yards to extend the streak, and he literally needed every last second of the season to get it done. It meant a lot to him, his teammates, the franchise and the fanbase that he extend his record. 

I love this guy so much on and off the field, and it's been a treat to watch his career play out. Year 12 is gonna be something special, and I'm here for it.

After losing Puka Nacua in week 1 to a burst bursa sac and Cooper Kupp in week 2 to an ankle injury the Rams and Matthew Stafford got off to a slow 1-4 start before their bye. However, rallying after the important rest of that bye, Stafford showed he was still one of the premier QBs in the NFL leading the Rams to a post-bye 9-2 record.

Taking down the 5-1 Vikings in week 7 on Nacua and Kupp's return with 4 Touchdown passes (more than he'd had for the entire first 6 games of the season) and even slinging it with the best of them beating Josh Allen and the 10-2 Buffalo Bills with a 320 YD, 132.6 RTG performance in week 14. Stafford proved that once he has his weapons around him, he can still do it in the clutch moments - no matter the competition. 

While Stafford's production slowed down towards the end of the regular season due to [reportedly playing through a cracked ribs injury he received in week 15](https://ugawire-eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/bulldogs/football/2025/01/26/matthew-stafford-georgia-football-la-rams-ribs-injury/77956704007/). His 4-1 record within the division and vital performances against strong double digit winning teams allowed the Rams victory over Seattle on strength-of-victory tie-breakers and into the playoffs as Division Champions. 

He and the Rams would eventually fall short, but not without giving a snowy Lincoln Financial Field and the Super Bowl champions a few nail biting downs where they questioned ['Would Matthew Stafford do it again.'](https://i.imgur.com/KcAlCgS.png)

Jenkins‚Äô versatility has been well documented throughout the years; he is able to play every position on the line at a high level. While he mostly stayed at left guard this year, he had to temporarily take over other roles due to injuries (i.e. center against Detroit). And honestly? Massive improvement on the play at those positions. With Myers departure in free agency, a permanent move to center is on the cards for next year, and I think the expectation is that he will be one of the very best centers in the league.

His technique and strength in pass-blocking at left guard are some of the best in the league. Only 16 total pressures (1 sack) allowed in 525 pass-blocking snaps give him one of the lowest pressure rates among guards for the season, lowest among qualifying left guards in fact. Look at him just stand up the poor Cardinals 1-tech [here](https://streamable.com/uxh9c2). Or [here](https://streamable.com/s2u6ej) impede the looping Gervon Dexter with Dexter‚Äôs own teammate that Jenkins put on his ass. 

In addition to being the Packers most frequent puller, his strength in the run game lies in moving to the second level directly or off combo blocks. [Here's](https://streamable.com/tii5uk) an outside zone where Jenkins directly moves to the second level to feast on Christian Rozeboom. [Here](https://streamable.com/na4atu) he sends the 1-tech moving backwards by himself before Myers picks him up on the combo block, then climbing to displace the linebacker to create the hole Jacobs hits. What a beast. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be anything fancy, sometimes Jenkins just manhandles his guy 1-on-1, like on [this](https://streamable.com/v7e5vh) goal line block to create the hole for the TD run.

Jenkins' importance to the team became very apparent when he went down with a stinger in the 1st quarter of the playoff game against the Eagles, after which the Packers offensive line just collectively fell apart. With Aaron Banks penciled in as the new starting left guard, it‚Äôs no secret that the position will suffer a massive downgrade. But a full season of Jenkins at center can hopefully bring us to a level of play at the position we haven‚Äôt seen since Corey Linsley.

#**#87 - Zach Tom - Green Bay Packers - Offensive Tackle**

Zach Tom had a hell of a 2024 campaign to solidify him as one of the best right tackles in the league, a rung of two below the elite of the elite at his position. While he may not be a physical behemoth like Penei Sewell or possess the impenetrable pass-blocking prowess of Lane Johnson, Tom's mobility, positioning and consistency made him the best player on an offensive line that only allowed 22 sacks in the season, the 2nd fewest of any team.

In pass blocking, the Packers have complete faith in Zach Tom as he is often left without help against the opponent's left edge. According to [ESPN Analytics](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41040723/2024-nfl-win-rates-top-teams-players-rankings), only Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata had double team help at a lower rate while having a higher pass blocking win rate. Zach's pass blocking begins with his big first step that makes it very hard to beat him outside, yet he possesses the speed to recover inside should his opponent try to beat him there. His mobility and reaction time also make him effective against stunts. Tom is excellent against fancy pass rushing moves; particularly [spin moves](https://streamable.com/t3ygzd).

Tom's speed off the snap makes him an excellent lineman in outside zone runs as it allows him to succeed in his reach blocks. [Here's](https://streamable.com/lqbtz1) a reach block on Jeff Simmons that helps create a massive hole for the running back. His mobility also allows him to climb to the second level quickly to clear out linebackers. [Here](https://streamable.com/7k1yxz) he quickly dodges the defensive lineman set up for the trap before blocking the linebacker to spring Jacobs for a big gain.

Unfortunately, his season came to an end in the playoffs against the Eagles, where he had his worst game all year. Here's to hoping he can leave that performance in the rear-view and pick up where he left off in the regular season in 2025.

Let‚Äôs be clear about something, Jessie Bates has been one of the most influential and underrated safeties in football for years. Gifted with both the physicality and football IQ to be a point of difference both vs the run and the pass, week after week he impacted the game in ways that very few safeties can. Moments like the game sealing interception against the eventual Super Bowl Champions or the force fumble down late against the Bucs stick in my mind as impact plays when the Falcons needed them most.

In most cases a Safety only excels in either run defense or pass defense, but Bates is one of the few unicorns that are equally strong in both facets of the game. Setting the standard for his teammates, he lead the team in INTs (4), FFs (4) and was second in tackles (102) and PDs (10) showing both his knack for takeaways but also his down-to-down consistency.

Grading out as PFF‚Äôs 12th highest Safety overall, he was one of only four to rank top 20 in both run defense and passing defense. Although the Falcon‚Äôs defense as a whole struggled to generate pressure on the QB, the Falcon‚Äôs were one of the leagues best at limiting explosive plays which Bates was routinely containing the deepest coverages. Yes, he wasn‚Äôt the All Pro player that he showed to be in 2023, but he has proven himself to be one of the most consistent Safeties in the NFL since the turn of the decade and he isn‚Äôt slowing down.

If we are going to talk about big, beefy, well-rounded offensive guards that are among the best in the NFL, Landon Dickerson has cemented his name in that list. The 4-year starter out of Alabama has made a home for himself at left guard next to the other behemoth of a man in Jordan Mailata. Together, they are a well-built wall that makes opposing DLs pay for it.   
  
In 2024, Dickerson posted top 10 marks in run and pass protection per PFF. His growth in pass protection stands out but his physical nature as a run blocker is OL porn for anyone who watches it. He's versatile allowing him to execute a variety of schemes but he really shines when he is able to [get to the second level](https://streamable.com/py4z4j) to open up home run shots. He's a [powerful](https://streamable.com/i9xlbh) blocker that makes pancakes even when you feel like it won't happen. Then [when blocking in tandem with Mailata](https://streamable.com/xi7snp), it's like trying to push back against a dump truck at full speed. More impressively, for a man his size, [he's nimble](https://bsky.app/profile/nflbot.bsky.social/post/3li3symrrac2u) and a star pupil at Stoutland University.   
  
Any list that discusses the top guards in the league will have Landon Dickerson's name on it and for good reason. He's a complete player on a unit filled with dominant players and a team leader. And if you choose to leave Landon Dickerson off your list, [we know he'll choose violence.](https://streamable.com/dl3f3u). So I'll leave you with Dickerson's own words and like me maybe you'll choose to run through a wall:

To say less, Armstead has always been a very elusive player. Out of a dozen seasons Terron had only managed to exceed 14 games played in a season only four times in his career‚Äîone of those seasons being the one this entire list is about.

There is something very on brand that the fact Armstead scored 3rd overall on PFF (among 140 qualifying players) and allowed a top 10 pressure rate of just 3.4% isn't as surprising as the fact he hit the 15 game threshold for only the second time in his career (2019). But even more surprising: The fact he would retire immediately after and leave the keys to the Dolphins offensive line somewhere in the locker room.

...Or is it really that much of a shock? He is turning 34 and he's been fighting injury since *ad infinitum*. Just like it always had, Armstead's generational talent begins to fade from view, however this time for good.  In a brutal game, he played beautifully.

Demario Davis, entering his 13th NFL season, missed just one game (in Week 4 due to an injury) and played in all 16 remaining contests. He set a career high with 136 tackles (69 of which were solo), marking his seventh consecutive season with over 100 tackles since joining the Saints in 2018. His stat line also included five tackles for loss (with two sacks), seven passes defensed, and an interception.

The Week 14 matchup against Washington was one of the season highlights, where Davis recorded a season-high 14 tackles along with a sack.  

He almost never makes a mistake and is still motoring sideline to side in pass coverage and chasing down runners, I mean [watch](https://youtu.be/64ZQEDGa7qc?t=12) how fast he diagnoses this play and blows it up. Hes so damn saavy and smart and will forever be one of my favorite players of all time. Almost every play he‚Äôs flowing immediately to the ball and he makes life hell for running backs and young QBs.

We are entering a waning period of a golden age of linebacker play that features players like Bobby Wagner, Levonte David and Demario so enjoy them while they last because they are truly some of the all time greats.

You see it in every draft thread and every offseason thread. Every year, the Eagles have some defensive star fall ‚Äúass-backwards‚Äù into their lap. Howie obviously has some Kompromat on all the other execs in the‚Ä¶ wait. Hold on. This sounds familiar. Right, right. This was how I started my writeup of #91, Quinyon Mitchell. Welp, it holds true. After Philly took Q at #24 overall, the guy many thought we‚Äôd have a chance to grab at that spot as a consolation prize was still there at #40, and Howie made the move. He just keeps getting away with it. This was the first time the Eagles have ever taken two corners back-to-back with their first two selections, and the first time they‚Äôve selected two defensive backs 1-2 since 2002, when they took Lito Sheppard and Michael Lewis in the first and second (who were both 1st-team All-Pro in 2004, and the last time most Eagles fans remember us having a secondary of which to be proud). 


Coop wasn‚Äôt quite the hit immediately out the gate as his fellow rookie was, and didn‚Äôt earn his first start until week 6, which makes the way they were regarded by the end of the season seem even sillier. He immediately showed up and started making plays, [making life hell for the most schadenfreude-laden creature in the NFL.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrC4rvt_pE4) 


Folk still tend to underestimate the impact of a nickel/slot corner in the NFL, but DeJean [made his impact known.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzdsectOBs8) 


DeJean is an utter goofball who has been completely embraced by the city and the team‚Äôs fans. My favorite non-gameplay clip of the year is this [ephemeral trip of Coop, on the sideline, just shouting his buddy‚Äôs name along with the stadium announcer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvXRRMGF-TE) as he makes play after play. 


[He even has his own song!](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gJOwxl3cgTs) Which frankly is reaching ‚ÄúWeird Al version of the song replaces the real one‚Äù levels of unseating the source material in my brain. There‚Äôs also the [CJ Gardner-Johnson remix. 
](https://youtu.be/VpB6qX0cGD0)

The one downside I can say for Coop and how incredibly the guy played in his first year is the Eagles now have one of those players who when people chant his name you get [‚ÄúI was saying boo-urns‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kpb8eu1pEY) moments.

He was also the primary punt returner, but by the end of the season we were so impressed and reliant on his primary skills many of us began getting pretty squeamish about having him out there fielding punts. That‚Äôs how good he is. Like Desean Jackson, without the Antisemitism. 


And all of this was based on regular season only but I have to add here as the footnote: His first pick of the ‚Äúseason‚Äù was in the Super Bowl: Eagles already up 10-zip,[ DeJawn reads Mahomes like a book, grabs the pick, makes the moves, runs it all the way back.](https://youtu.be/Ino733c-Jqc?si=sTOHO00TlfLrhkBT&t=50) The rout is on, and it‚Äôs only the first half. Legacy cemented already. 


Q and Coop were just ranked the [#3 CB duo in the NFL by PFF](https://athlonsports.com/nfl/philadelphia-eagles/eagles-quinyon-mitchell-and-cooper-dejean-already-ranked-among-nfls-best-cb-duos-). Say what you will about PFF, I get it, but between these two youngsters and Blankenship, the Eagles secondary is in an incredible place.



#**#81 - Drake London - Atlanta Falcons - Wide Receiver**

Drake London‚Äôs 2024 season was unquestionably a statement. Entering his third year, London finally got the spotlight he‚Äôd been waiting for, and he delivered. With over 1,200 receiving yards and 9 touchdowns, London became the engine of Atlanta‚Äôs passing game, establishing himself as a bona fide WR1.

His route-running sharpened, his contested catch ability remained elite, and when Atlanta finally leaned into a more aggressive aerial attack after the switch to Michael Penix Jr., London‚Äôs performance absolutely surged. This is what really sells London, and the fact that terrible QB play was hurting his production.

The highlight reel speaks for itself: a game-winning TD against the Eagles, a 150+ yard performance against the Bucs, and a 187-yard, two-touchdown explosion in the season finale. Each one a reminder of what he can do when featured, and I wouldn't be surprised if he found himself higher on this list next season (at all).

While the Falcons once again were a bit dysfunctional and missed the playoffs, London‚Äôs emergence alongside Bijan Robinson's consistency and Penix's breakout gives the team a young core that looks ready to make noise. If 2024 was the breakout for London, 2025 might be the takeover.

3 Super Bowl appearances

Is this the best QB draft class since 2004 & 1983?

We need your help. This subreddit has 26 million subscribers and right now we have the most active mods we‚Äôve had in years, which is 7. For perspective the next highest subreddit has 19, and the one above that has 24.

We need more mods and we would prefer they be actively involved in the DIY subreddit. That doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be chronically online. It doesn‚Äôt mean you have to participate in shaping the policy about where the sub goes (if you don‚Äôt want to), we just need people to understand what posts are allowed, what aren‚Äôt, and to approve / disapprove posts. That‚Äôs it. If you really want to contribute you can respond to modmail and flagged posts. Any amount you can do per week will help us and the more people who are willing, the less we all have to do. We need to ***do it ourselves***, because I‚Äôm afraid reddit has been very clear, they just don‚Äôt have the budget to hire mods for us (hardy har har).

We appreciate anyone who‚Äôs willing to put in a bit of time every week or every few days to help us out. Please respond in this thread or leave a message in modmail if you‚Äôre interested and keep up the great projects. Cheers.

Materials, a Razer blade, buffing pad attached to a drill, ceramic cooktop cleaning paste ( I use weimans but I've seen cermabryte and a few others) and Lucas oil metal polish (it's an automotive product), paper towels and or rags

Step 1, clean the surface off with past if it's greasy etc. then take a bunch of paste and squirt it around each burner. The objective is to create a wet paste environment so the Razer blade doesn't scratch the cooktop. Use a Razer blade and scrape off any burned on mess. Be sure to go around the burners and also in the middle. You'll feel the blade grab and you have to really dig at some of it. Be sure to wipe away the paste as it dries and reapply as needed. You'll be left with something that looks like photo 2. 

Step 2, shake up the Lucas metal polish and put some on the burner, start with about a quarter sized amount as this stuff goes a long way. Set your drill to low speed and use the buffing pad to work the product around the burner. Pick up speed and add more product as needed. We are looking for a somewhat foamy white liquid. This step can take a long time and you may need to wipe the product away to check on progress and reapply it a few times. Move on to the next burner when finished with each one. You can switch to speed 2 to help but beware you'll send product flying everywhere. 

Step 3, use the paste again to clean up the oil residue left. It won't completely remove scratches but the cloudiness, burned on food and other imperfections should be gone and it will look way better than what it did before. 

As you can see in the photo the whole process took me around 30 minutes and this stove was BAD. you can use this as a general maintenance process, or a restorative process to make your stove look way better than before. "

>Wright discussed the Knicks' head coaching gig briefly with Leon Rose - the team's president of basketball operations - but was never offered the job or asked to interview for the position, Davis added.

>Wright shockingly retired in 2022 after guiding the Wildcats to a pair of national titles over 21 years at the helm. He also won eight Big East regular-season titles, five Big East Tournament crowns, and a pair of Naismith College Coach of the Year awards during his tenure.

Windy on a potential Garland for Suggs trade:

""That can't be the trade,""

""Darius Garland is an All-Star. Jalen Suggs is not. So there would have to be other aspects of that trade before I would consider it. If I were the Cavs, if you were to say to me, is Jalen Suggs a player that the Cavs should have interest in? 

I would say, yeah, because Jalen Suggs is from the same class of players that a guy like Jrue Holiday and Alex Caruso are. Although he's about to start a big new contract, and that's one of the things about the trade like that. 

That trade couldn't take place, for example, until after July 1. Well, I mean, it could take place, but you couldn't trade those guys for each other, really, until after July 1. And then once you go to July 1, you're in the second apron.""

Well this is the thread for you. **This monthly megathread is meant to contain questions about what to play and suggestions to others on what to play**.

&#x200B;

Now to make this work best and not just be spammed with ""What should I play?"", **please be in-depth in what type of games you are looking for, and when giving advice it would be appreciated if you're more detailed than ""I think X game is good""**. There are too many games to be able to properly suggest something with no background information, like-wise commenting a game title and saying you like the game offers no actual value.

&#x200B;

The main purpose of this thread is to contain questions on what to play and advice to others on what to play, but feel free to ask and discuss freely in the comments regarding games whether you want advice on what to play, want to give advice to others on what to play, share a hidden gem you found, discussions & questions about discounts, sales, events, or just general games discussion."

How the heck did I end up receiving this in 2025? I didn't get it from a trade, so the only explanations I can think of is:  
1. Someone gifted it to me, but the gift notifications for these don't work anymore, so it just goes straight to your inventory.

2. I might have gifted this to someone a long time ago and either the gift offer expired after like 10 years, or for some reason they decided to decline it now and the notifications for this is also broken.

Throughout some of my games, I'll have my teammates say ""this is my first game of Overwatch,"" or ""this is my first time on Stadium,"" and I always ask ""Why are you in Pro and not Rookie?"" and they'll just say IDK. 

For instance, last night I had a tank who had less than 5 hrs on OW, but most of the time in these cases my teammates are only new to stadium. Of course, I've seen the enemy team with new players as well.

It's slightly annoying because not only do they not know how to play OW, they don't understand how to use powers and upgrades, and its just a steamroll when there's a new player in the lobby. Stadium is a competitive game mode, after all.

How are new players getting in high ranks such as Pro?"

The slower pace, the sense of community, and the more grounded world really reminded me of why I fell in love with this game in the first place.

Then I jumped into Cataclysm and MoP to try them again‚Ä¶ and suddenly the game felt like something completely different.

In my opinion, it doesn‚Äôt really feel like Classic anymore. The world feels more disconnected, leveling is rushed, and the game seems to push you towards fast rewards instead of meaningful exploration.

But what struck me the most is the community, or rather, the lack of it. In Season of Discovery, people were talking, grouping up, helping each other. In Cataclysm/MoP, it honestly feels more like a singleplayer game where everyone is just rushing through content without much interaction.

It‚Äôs strange, it‚Äôs still the same game in many ways, but it no longer gives me that same feeling of immersion and adventure. Has anyone else experienced this? Curious to hear your thoughts."
